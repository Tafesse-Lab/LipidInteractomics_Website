    "text": "Abstract\nPhosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a ubiquitous lipid species in higher eukaryotes which resides preferentially in mitochondria. Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initial-ly concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interac-tome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use."

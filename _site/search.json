Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nPhosphatidic Acid   \nPhosphatidylethanolamine   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nPA\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nPE\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange details\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange title: Trifunctional lipid derivatives: PEâ€™s mi-tochondrial interactome\nProteomeXchange accession: PXD059960\nPubMed ID: Not applicable\nPublication DOI: 10.1039/D4CC03599B\nProject Webpage: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD059960\nFTP Download: https://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2025/01/PXD059960\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotsRanked-order plotsMA Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Thomas et al., 2025.

Black proteins are unenriched in respect to both probes; Purple proteins are “enriched” with respect to only the probe on the x-axis; Green proteins are “enriched” with respect to only the probe on the y-axis; and Orange proteins are “enriched” in both probes.

Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nPhosphatidic Acid   \nPhosphatidylethanolamine   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nPA\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nPE\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange details\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange title: Trifunctional lipid derivatives: PEâ€™s mi-tochondrial interactome\nProteomeXchange accession: PXD059960\nPubMed ID: Not applicable\nPublication DOI: 10.1039/D4CC03599B\nProject Webpage: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD059960\nFTP Download: https://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2025/01/PXD059960\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotsRanked-order plotsMA Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Thomas et al., 2025.

While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Sphinganine   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nSpa\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcano plotRanked order plotMA Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Farley et al., 2024.

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nSphingosine\nDiacylglycerol\n8-3 Fatty acid\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n5 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\nDAG\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrifunctional Sphingosine",

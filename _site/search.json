While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuh7",

This is a form of R Markdown that is highly documented, and one can learn how to modify this site here: https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nThe overarching formatting of the site is controlled within the _quarto.yml file. Here one can update the site theme from the array of Bootswatch themes, or if you’re feeling ambitious you can design your own theme.\nWhen making updates to the site, one first edits/makes a file, then you use the Bash command “quarto render”. This will update the site directory within the _site folder. There are a lot of ways to do the editing, but it’s nicest to use the IDE Visual Studio Code because there’s a terminal in-window and you can see nice previews of what the site will look like without leaving the program.\nAny changes can then be pushed to the github repository; Netlify will pull the changes and automatically deploy the updated site! See site owners for Netlify login information and .git access. It will be TBD how GitHub ownership is transferred after I leave.\n\n\nQuarto formatting\nI have found that Quarto is highly documented and it’s pretty easy to figure out how to format or change the way things look (if all else fails, ask ChatGPT and you usually get a pretty good answer).\nAs a reference to help get you started, I very much appreciated this blog post by Richard Posert about using Quarto.\nI honestly get the most confused when it comes to formatting the _quarto.yml file because there aren’t many fully-fleshed examples out there for all the options. This is where I’ve (embarrassingly) leaned on ChatGPT for help – it’s not always right, but it’s usually close enough that you can make it work properly anyways.\nIf you want to add a page, you need to make a new .qmd file in the proper subfolder and render it as an .html file (conveniently, the Preview button in VS Code does that for you, but you can use whatever IDE you want). Then you need to add two lines to the .yml file so that the page is properly linked on the sidebar or navbar (first the href to denote the file path to the .html file, then the text to display on the page) – if you don’t add these, the page will remain unlinked and you’ll need to know the whole URL to find it (like this maintenance page).\nIf your data looks at all like Alix’s or Scotty’s, the ggplot functions I built in the ggplot_styles.R file will apply. Call the RankedOrderPlotStandard() and VolcanoPlotStandardized() functions to produce these plots with the same standardized formatting. On that note, you can alter the ggplot_styles.R file to change the standardized formatting.\nThere are a ton of things you can do within html divs, but I haven’t dipped my toes in those yet - use these to finely adjust how elements of each page look."

Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain their utility have not been thoroughly described. Here, we synthesize three palmitic acid derivatives with a diazirine at different positions on the acyl chain and examine their metabolism, subcellular localization, and protein interactions. We demonstrate that while they produce very similar metabolites and subcellular distributions, probes with the diazirine at either end pulldown distinct subsets of proteins after photo-crosslinking. This highlights the importance of thoughtful diazirine placement when developing probes based on biological molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuh7",

Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use.",

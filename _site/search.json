A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity‐based proximity labelling and identification of GPI‐interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI‐cell membrane interaction. Eighty‐eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI‐anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI‐related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nBifunctional Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (bf-GPI)\nBifunctional phosphatidyl moiety with &-D-glucoside (Control)\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nbf-GPI\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\nControl\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPrecursor ion intensity Label Free Quantitation (LFQ), performed using Proteome Discoverer\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional 1-10 Fatty Acid   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\n1-10 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

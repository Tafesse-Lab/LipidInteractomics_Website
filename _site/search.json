While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional 1-10 Fatty Acid   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\n1-10 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Sphinganine   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nSpa\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotRanked order plotMA Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Farley et al., 2024.

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Diacylglycerol   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n5 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\nDAG\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting\n\n\n\n\n*PSM data presentation still in development.\nSee Höglinger et al. 2017 for results in context with Diacylglycerol and 8-3 Fatty Acid data.",

We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo-crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo-crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional PI(3,4,5)P3\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting (in original publication)\nLabel free quantification (as reported here, enabled via fresh analysis by Frank Stein, EMBL – details below)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\nSamples were split into membrane and cytosolic fractions and analyzed as independent mass spec samples.

Batch effects were then removed, and missing values were imputed using a hybrid strategy: KNN imputation was applied to high-confidence proteins with replicate-level missingness, while low-confidence proteins were assigned minimum detected values (MinDet). The data were subsequently variance-stabilized and normalized, after which differential abundance testing was performed using the limma framework. Parallel analyses were also carried out with the fdrtool package, with significance thresholds defined consistently across methods. Proteins were classified according to standard criteria: hits (FDR &lt; 0.05 and |fold-change| &gt; 1.5), candidates (FDR &lt; 0.2 and |fold-change| &gt; 1.5), enriched candidates (FDR &lt; 0.2 and fold-change &gt; 1.5), enriched hits (FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold-change &gt; 1.5), and all others as non-significant.\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembrane Fraction\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotsRanked-order plotsMA Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student’s t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed).

Though this non-natural phospholipid routinely serves as a biomarker of chronic alcoholism, its pathophysiological roles remain unknown. We use a minimalist diazirine alkyne alcohol as an ethanol surrogate to generate clickable, photoaffinity lipid reporters of PEth localization and lipid–protein interactions via PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation. We use these tools to visualize phosphatidyl alcohols in a manner compatible with standard permeabilization and immunofluorescence methods. We also use click chemistry tagging, enrichment, and proteomics analysis to define the phosphatidyl alcohol interactome. Our analysis reveals an enrichment of putative interactors at various membrane locations, and we validate one such interaction with the single-pass transmembrane protein basigin/CD147. This study provides a comprehensive view of the molecular interactions of phosphatidyl alcohols with the cellular proteome and points to future work to connect such interactions to potential pathophysiological roles of PEth.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nPhosphatidyl Alcohol   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPSM\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\n\nVolcano plotsRanked order plotMA plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student’s t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed).

What little attention that NAPE has received has been devoted to understanding its metabolic functions as a precursor to N-acylethanolamines, bioactive lipids that act as endocannabinoids. Yet, levels of NAPE increase during myocardial infarction and ischemia, suggesting potential signaling roles for this lipid. Here, we exploit photoaffinity labeling (PAL) to identify NAPE-interacting proteins and elucidate signaling functions of NAPE. By positioning diazirine and alkyne groups in metabolically distinct regions of the NAPE molecule, we ensured that our PAL probe reported on interactions of NAPE and not NAE. Our studies identified several NAPE interactors, including two single-pass transmembrane proteins, CD147/Basigin and CD44, both of which serve as chaperones for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) from the SLC16A family that mediate lactate flux across the plasma membrane. Functional studies revealed that NAPE stimulates lactate efflux by MCTs dependent upon CD147 and CD44, establishing NAPE as a bona fide signaling lipid and pointing to potential physiological roles in metabolic and energy homeostasis that may be pathologically relevant in ischemia.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nBifunctional NAPE   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\n\nLEI-401\n30 min\n60 min\n30 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nSILAC\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\nNone\n\n\nLipid interactomics data analysis\nData as submitted by the original authors was not normalized.

While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional 1-10 Fatty Acid   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\n1-10 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n60 min\n5 min\n60 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\n\nVolcano plotRanked order plotMA Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Farley et al., 2024(B).

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Diacylglycerol   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n5 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\nDAG\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting\n\n\n\n\n*PSM data presentation still in development.\nSee Höglinger et al. 2017 for results in context with Diacylglycerol and 8-3 Fatty Acid data.",

Though this non-natural phospholipid routinely serves as a biomarker of chronic alcoholism, its pathophysiological roles remain unknown. We use a minimalist diazirine alkyne alcohol as an ethanol surrogate to generate clickable, photoaffinity lipid reporters of PEth localization and lipid–protein interactions via PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation. We use these tools to visualize phosphatidyl alcohols in a manner compatible with standard permeabilization and immunofluorescence methods. We also use click chemistry tagging, enrichment, and proteomics analysis to define the phosphatidyl alcohol interactome. Our analysis reveals an enrichment of putative interactors at various membrane locations, and we validate one such interaction with the single-pass transmembrane protein basigin/CD147. This study provides a comprehensive view of the molecular interactions of phosphatidyl alcohols with the cellular proteome and points to future work to connect such interactions to potential pathophysiological roles of PEth.\n\n\n\nPhosphatidyl Alcohol   \n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\n\n\nPSM\n\n\n\n\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download",

A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity‐based proximity labelling and identification of GPI‐interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI‐cell membrane interaction. Eighty‐eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI‐anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI‐related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.\n\n\n\nBifunctional Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (bf-GPI)\nBifunctional phosphatidyl moiety with &-D-glucoside (Control)\n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nbf-GPI\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\nControl\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecursor ion intensity Label Free Quantitation (LFQ), performed using Proteome Discoverer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download",

While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\n\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Sphinganine   \n\n\n\nHuh7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nSpa\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download",

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\n\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Diacylglycerol   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n5 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\nDAG\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide spectral counting",

    "text": "Hello Dr. Ceci and Dr. Robinson,\nWe are quite excited that our manuscript is acceptable for publication and are happy to incorporate further clarifications about our data handling and the steps taken to align each dataset within the framework of the site. We are again grateful to the reviewers for taking the time to thoughtfully consider our manuscripts and the changes we incorporated in this newest version of our manuscript and our site.\nWe see two fundamental suggestions between the reviewers: (1) clarification of the data handling and alignment and (2) establishment of a more robust/scalable data management model.\nTo the first point, we have added further clarifying text to the manuscript seeking to emphasize that the data incorporated on the site is acquired through direct communication with authors – where possible – and from publicly available datasets published with the original studies. Further, we have added a short note on the raw data download section of the Study Information dropdown tab on each page to describe the source of the associated dataset (either provided by the authors or pulled from the published dataset).\nWe have also sought to clarify the data handling by adding a similar summary note to the sStudy Information dropdown tab of each page describing the data wrangling performed. For most datasets, this is merely the re-naming of data columns and the inclusion of a statistical significance column which allows for color-coding in the automated plotting functions – where “significance” is as defined in each original publication. As such, we further emphasize that direct comparison between studies is still not intended to be a quantitative method, but to give lipid researchers a sense of the similarities and differences in the sets of enriched hits between different lipid probes. A section has been added to our Data Analysis and Statistics background page describing the limitations of the comparison tool – and this section is linked on the comparison page.\nTo the reviewers’ second point regarding a scalable and AI-compatible data model, we wholeheartedly agree that our site’s impact would be greatly increased with a more robust underlying data model. Notably, however, this first implementation of our site incorporates most, if not all, currently published lipid interactome datasets – this is a developing field, and while interest is expanding (in part due to this effort), the scalability of the site is currently manageable via manual addition of new datasets.\nWe seek to emphasize that the suggested features would require root-level changes that are currently beyond our reach in both funding and skillset. We firmly aim to reconstruct the site with greater data management and a more scalable structure in its next iteration. At present, we believe that the key features of the site are of great benefit to lipid researchers: there is no comparable resource that so improves the findability and accessibility of these datasets, nor any other effort to make these datasets interoperable (as incomplete as ours is), and the downloadability of these datasets dramatically increases the reusability of these datasets.\nWe hope that the clarifying changes to our manuscript and the above-noted sections of our site are sufficient to address the reviewers’ concerns. We thank them again for their time and consideration, and we thank the editors at Bioinformatics for this opportunity to publish our Application Note.\nBest,\nDr. Fikadu Tafesse\n\nSummary of revisions\n\nClarifying text has been added to the manuscript to describe the source of datasets and the handling of data.\nDescriptive text has been added to each Study Information section of the site in order to clarify the source of the dataset (i.e. provided by the authors or as published/publicly available) and the steps taken to wrangle the dataset into alignment with the visualization functions on the site.\nA new section of the Data Analysis and Statistics background page clarifying the broad steps taken to align each dataset for inclusion in the site (e.g. column name alignment, the creation of a statistical annotation column, etc). This section is linked to from the dataset comparison tool to direct users who seek more information.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "section": "Interactomics Experimental schema",
    "text": "Interactomics Experimental schema\nIn this overview, we aim to explain the fundamental procedures of utilizing lipid probes in proteomics analysis. Figure 1 depicts the steps described below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCell treatment\nAs has been reported previously by Höglinger et al. (2017), Muller et al. (2021), Farley et al. (2024), Farley et al. (2024), and Thomas et al. (2025), lipid probes are readily taken up by cell membranes within minutes upon treatment with lipid probes at concentrations ranging from 2 (as for trifunctional sphingosine and sphinganine) to 5 (as for trifunctional phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine) to 100 (as for trifunctional diacylglycerol)1–5. These studies utilized the inherent fluorescence of the coumarin cage to validate the uptake and wide intercalation of the lipid probes throughout the cell6.\n\n\nUncaging\nIrradiation with 405 nm wavelength light induces the release of the coumarin photocage and thus allows for the recognition and metabolism of the headgroup of the lipid probe (See our Coumarin overview for more background on using the coumarin photocage).\nSubstantial work has validated that these lipid probes are recognized by the cell as their native counterparts, as the remaining functional groups have minimal effect on the probes’ biophysical properties. This has been validated in numerous studies, including Höglinger et al. (2015) and Höglinger et al. (2017), Muller et al. (2020) and Muller et al. (2020), and Farley et al. (2024) and Farley et al. (2024)1,2,7,8.\n\n\nCrosslinking\nIrradiation with 355 nm wavelength light induces the production of a reactive carbene which readily inserts itself into any nearby biochemical bond (See our Diazirine overview for more background on diazirine crosslinking). Notably, the majority of probes will likely crosslink with either water or with neighboring lipids. Quantitative proteomics analysis will fully ignore these conjugates, as only enriched peptides will be measured in the final mass spectrometry analysis (described below in our Mass spectrometry overview).\nThe covalently bound lipid protein conjugates which form after crosslinking are highly stable and thus are ideally amenable toward stringent enrichment and washing, producing a high-quality sample with few non-specific proteins tagging along.\n\n\nCell lysis and sample collection\nDepending on application, may want to perform a membrane prep or otherwise isolate an organelle of interest (e.g. mitochondrial enrichment, if one is seeking mitochondrial interactions)\nDue to the high stability of the diazirine crosslinking bond, no extra steps need to be taken to ensure that interactions are maintained – lysis can be as aggressive as one wishes.\nIn general, samples due for mass spectrometry analysis should be kept with as little detergent as possible to protect the instrument – however, because the crosslinking bond is covalent and the downstream affinity purification is covalent, these samples may be washed very stringently and thus remove effectively all contaminating detergents. Thus, a mild detergent such as NP-40 can be included in the lysis buffer of these samples.\n\n\nAffinity purification of probe-conjugated proteins\n(See our Alkyne overview for more background on alkyne click chemistry)\n\nExample using azide beads: Perform click chemistry reaction in presence of beads coated with picolyl-azide functional groups for covalent capture\nConjugates of protein-lipid-bead are covalently bound and can thus be stringently washed with detergent solutions to remove non-specific proteins. Detergent can then be removed with repeated high volume washes of 8 M urea and 20 % acetonitrile.\nCaptured proteins are then reduced and alkylated on-bead.\nPeptides are digested off the protein-lipid-bead conjugates via tryptic digest. Digested peptides are then desalted to remove any remaining contaminants using reverse phase desalting columns.\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry analysis\nBroadly, all mass spectrometry techniques for proteomic identification of differentially-enriched proteins will involve injection into a mass spectrometer via liquid chromatography. Within the mass spectrometer, individual peptides can be isolated and fragmented to determine their sequence.\nThere are several methodologies commonly used to quantify mass spectrometry data. At the highest level, these may be separated into label-free and label-based quantification techniques. Both categories are valid for reporting differential enrichment, and each has pros and cons – discussed in detail below.\n\nLabel-Free Quantification\nLabel-free quantification (LFQ) is a widely used mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach that estimates protein abundance without chemical labeling. Instead, it relies on comparing the summed intensity of detected peptides across different samples analyzed under identical conditions.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPeptide Detection (MS1): Peptides are isolated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nPeptide Sequencing (MS2): Selected peptide ions are fragmented, and the resulting spectra determine peptide sequences.\nQuantification: The total signal intensity of all identified peptides corresponding to a protein is summed as a proxy for its abundance.\nComparison Across Samples: Samples prepared and analyzed using the same LC-MS/MS protocol can be compared using peptide-spectrum match (PSM) counts as an abundance proxy.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Label-Free Quantification\n\nCost-Effective & Simple Sample Preparation: Unlike labeling methods (e.g., TMT), LFQ does not require expensive reagents or complex modifications, making it more accessible.\nFlexible & Widely Used: Compatible with various experimental designs and allows for comparisons across many samples without multiplexing constraints.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nPotential Bias from Co-Elution: High-abundance peptides can overshadow low-abundance ones, reducing the number of reliably quantified peptides.\nRun-to-Run Variability: LFQ requires separate MS runs for each sample, making it susceptible to differences in instrument calibration, chromatography conditions, or sample handling. Careful quality control is necessary to minimize artificial differences.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nLabel-free quantification is a practical and widely used method for proteomics research. While cost-effective and flexible, its accuracy depends on careful experimental design and quality control to reduce variability.\n\n\n\nIsotopic Label-based quantification\nAll label-based mass spectrometry quantification methods use stable isotopes to distinguish the source of proteins within a pooled collective of several experimental samples. Previously, the technique known as Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) was common, though this has fallen out of use due to significant cost and difficult sample preparation.\nAn early (and still used) form of isotopic labeling was known as Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC). This method allows for quantification of the relative protein abundances between two or three conditions in cell culture.\nModern isotopic label-based techniques such as iTRAQ (isotopic Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantification) and TMT (Tandem Mass Tagging) have become the norm. Isotopic labeling is a powerful quantitative mass spectrometry technique that enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in a single MS run. This approach improves efficiency and allows for precise relative quantification of proteins across experimental conditions. For the purposes of this overview, we will focus on TMT as it has greater capacity for samples per experiment (16+ as opposed to 8), and the techniques are fundamentally similar.\n\nHow SILAC Works:\n\nIsotopic Labeling: Independent cell culturing conditions are pre-treated with media containing with differing amino acid composition, encoding the peptides of each condition with either “heavy” arginine and lysine residues (containing C13 isotopes) or “light” (containing a standard proportion of C12 isotopes). Media treatments are typically for several days or weeks to allow for substantial incorporation of heavy/light labeled isotopes into cells (this is typically dependent on the rate of cell division).\nExperimental conditions: After isotopic labeling, the experimental conditions can be applied. In the case of lipid probe interactions studies, one would treat the cells with probe, and either uncage via UV irradiation or leave caged for control. The cells are then collected, lysed and protein is collected.\nSample pooling: After protein collection, samples can be pooled, digested, and desalted.\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\n\n\nMS1 (Peptide Isolation): Heavy and Light peptides will differ in m/z depending on their composition of lysine and arginine (a heavy peptide with a single lysine residue will be 6 daltons heavier than its light counterpart). These Heavy/Light peptide pairs will be isolated independently for MS2 analysis.\n\n-   **MS2 (Peptide Sequencing & Tag Fragmentation):** Peptides are fragmented for sequence identification.\n\nQuantification: The relative abundance of a given peptide can be calculated from the Heavy/Light MS1 ratio – thus, the quantification data is collected at the MS1 level, and is limited by the MS1 duty cycle. For this reason, SILAC can have a high sensitivity to abundant peptides “swamping” the signal of less abundant peptides. A high degree of fractionation is frequently needed to maximize protein identifications.\nComparison and Statistics: The fold-change in protein abundance is directly encoded in the Heavy/Light ratio of SILAC peptide pairs. Typically a Student’s t-test can be used to calculate the statistical significance of each protein.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of SILAC\n\nSimple and Robust: Because the isotopic labeling is accomplished via media feeding, there are no challenging chemical reactions and a high degree of incorporation can be achieved reliably in vitro. Similarly, the sample pooling occurs at a very early stage in the sample preparation process, limiting any biasing losses of one sample or its control.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages/Limitations of SILAC\n\nLong Label Incorporation Time: Because the rate of label incorporation is dependent on the cell division rate, slowly-dividing cells (e.g. neurons, organoids) can be prohibitively expensive to perform.\nLow Factor of Multiplexing: As of this writing, only two or three conditions can be compared within a single multiplex cassette.\nMS1 Quantification Sacrifices Protein IDs: Because SILAC quantification is at the MS1 level, one can only acquire data for half as many unique peptide IDs (or one third, in the case of Triple SILAC).\nLimited to Laboratory Samples: Because the samples must be pre-treated with heavy or light media, only cell cultures or small lab animals are conducive to SILAC analysis. It is impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to investigate biopsied human samples or larger tissues using SILAC.\n\n\n\nSILAC Conclusion\nWhile SILAC is a powerful technique, its limitations have resulted in a general reduction in its use in interaction experiments. Among the datasets presented in this repository at the time of writing, only the dataset presented in Chiu et al. 2025 was prepared using SILAC9.\n\n\nHow TMT & iTRAQ Work:\n\nChemical Labeling: Each sample is chemically tagged with a unique TMT or iTRAQ label, which consists of a reactive group binding to peptides and a mass reporter for sample differentiation.\nSample Pooling: Labeled samples are combined into a single pooled group, reducing the need for separate MS runs.\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\n\nMS1 (Peptide Isolation): Peptides are separated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nMS2 (Peptide Sequencing & Tag Fragmentation): Peptides are fragmented for sequence identification, and TMT/iTRAQ mass tags fragment to generate reporter ions.\n\nQuantification: The intensity of reporter ions reveals the relative abundance of peptides across the original samples.\nComparison Across Samples: Within a TMT cassette (typically 16 samples), relative protein abundance is calculated from the reporter ion intensities. A pooled control channel enables comparison across cassettes, allowing many samples to be analyzed in a single experiment or large-scale study. iTRAQ has fallen out of favor somewhat because it is limited to 4 samples per cassette, though it is still commonly used.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of TMT/iTRAQ Labeling\n\nIncreased Throughput & Efficiency: Enables multiplexing of many samples (e.g., 16 or more), reducing the number of separate MS runs.\nDeeper Proteome Coverage: Pooled samples can be fractionated (e.g., by cation exchange chromatography), enhancing detection of low-abundance peptides.\nImproved Quantification Accuracy: Since all samples are analyzed in the same MS run, technical variability between runs is minimized.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nHigher Cost: TMT reagents and high-end mass spectrometers add to the expense.\nComplex Sample Preparation: Requires additional steps for labeling, pooling, and fractionation, increasing the risk of sample handling variability.\nNormalization Requirement: Accurate quantification requires equal protein input across samples to avoid artificial balancing biases.\nDemanding Instrumentation & Expertise: Requires high-resolution mass spectrometers, often necessitating specialized facilities.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nTMT- or iTRAQ based mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for large-scale proteomics, offering high-throughput, precise, and deep proteome coverage. While it requires advanced instrumentation and careful sample preparation, its ability to multiplex multiple samples in a single run makes it an attractive option for high-confidence protein quantification."

For example, a point on the far left of the MA plot had relatively low total abundance and may be more sensitive to dramatic changes in enrichment – whereas points to the right were substantially more abundant in the sample and will be less sensitive to change.\nThus, “significantly enriched” proteins with higher A intensity may be more trustworthy than those with lower A values.\n\n\n\nHeat Maps\n\nIn cases where ratiometric data is not available, heat maps have been employed to display relative enrichment between conditions.\n\nFor example, Höglinger et al. 2017 reports only peptide spectral mapping counts.

    "section": "Introduction: Why Study Lipid Interactomes?",
    "text": "Introduction: Why Study Lipid Interactomes?\nAt its core, biology is a complex network of chemical interactions. Every biological process—from metabolism to signaling—depends on the physical interactions between molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. While proteins have long been the primary focus of interaction studies, lipids play an equally crucial yet often under-appreciated role in cellular function. Therefore, there is a need for detailed knowledge of lipid-protein interactions (the lipid interactome). To learn about diseases and to find new therapeutic targets, in the comparison of the lipid interactomes of healthy and diseased cells and tissue is currently developing into a new field of lipid biology.\n\nLipid-Lipid Interactions and Membrane Properties\nLipids are primarily organized within membrane bilayers, where their interactions define critical membrane properties such as rigidity, fluidity, and resistance to detergents. By studying lipid-lipid interactions and lipid interactomes, researchers will gain deeper insight into how these molecular interactions influence local and global membrane architecture and dynamics. Understanding these interactions and interactomes is essential for unraveling fundamental processes such as vesicle trafficking, cell division, cell signaling, and membrane compartmentalization.\n\n\nLipids as Signaling Molecules\nBeyond their structural roles, many lipids have been increasingly recognized as key signaling molecules. For example, the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a pivotal role in immune function. S1P binds to a specific family of receptors, triggering T cell migration (extravasation) and guiding their movement toward sites of infection. Rapidly turned-over phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate triggers cell survival, growth, movement, and proliferation. These examples highlight how lipid signaling can affect cellular behavior and physiological responses.\n\n\nLipids in Disease\nMany diseases are caused by or affiliated with a lack or an accumulation of lipids, e.g. in atherosclerosis of in lipid storage diseases. However, recent evidence shows that in many if not most disease states specific lipid species are up- or down-regulated. A good example are viral and bacterial infections. If we learn about the effects of these altered lipids, we might identify new biochemical mechanisms essential for disease development and hence new therapeutic targets.\n\n\nLipid-Protein Interactions: Unlocking Cellular Communication\nA single lipid species can interact with a diverse array of proteins, influencing everything from receptor activation to intracellular signaling cascades. Mapping these lipid-protein interactions provides a powerful approach to understanding how lipids exert their wide-ranging effects on cellular processes. By deciphering lipid interactomes, researchers can uncover novel regulatory mechanisms and potentially identify new therapeutic targets in diseases where lipid signaling is dysregulated."

In addition, synthetic lipid tools are designed to provide a defined composition of fatty acids and carbon backbones connected to a specific head group while genetic and pharmacological methods are more likely to produce a diverse group of lipid species. The lipid binding pocket of a protein might only in some cases be a great therapeutic target while the function of the lipid binding protein might well be.\n\nWhy Lipids Require a Different Approach\nAdvances in genetic engineering—such as CRISPR and de novo gene synthesis—have revolutionized the study of nucleic acids and proteins. These techniques enable precise modifications, such as altering enzyme activity, redirecting proteins to different subcellular locations, modifying binding domains, and tagging proteins for visualization or isolation.\nIn contrast, lipids present unique challenges that make genetic approaches impractical. Unlike proteins, which are directly encoded in DNA, lipids are synthesized enzymatically. Their structures cannot be modified in living cells through genetic manipulation alone. Traditional approaches, such as gene knockouts or knock-ins, can broadly alter lipid composition but do not allow for precise control over individual lipid species.\nLipids are also much smaller than proteins, often composed of just a few dozen atoms. Even minor modifications can significantly alter their biophysical properties and biological function. Unlike proteins, which can tolerate the addition of large fluorescent or affinity tags, lipids tolerate only minimal chemical modifications to preserve their activity.\nAdditionally, lipids exist within a highly dynamic metabolic network, where they are continuously synthesized, modified, and degraded. Some signaling lipids, such as sphingosine, ceramide, and phosphatidic acid, have extremely short half-lives – sometimes less than a minute -— making them difficult to track in real-time.\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have developed synthetic lipid analogs with chemical modifications that allow for targeted investigation while preserving essential biological properties. The following sections detail key modifications used in functional lipid probes.\n\n\nThe Role of Synthetic Lipid Analogs\nTo overcome the challenges outlined above, researchers have developed synthetic analogs of native lipids. These modified lipids allow for precise investigation of lipid function while preserving their essential biological properties. The key modifications used in this approach include one to three functional modifications, namely a photo-crosslinking group (usually a diazirine), an alkyne group for click chemistry, and a photo-removable (cage) group for preventing premature probe metabolism.\n\nDiazirine Group\nLipid-protein interactions are inherently transient and dynamic, making them particularly challenging to capture and study. Unlike protein-protein interactions, which often rely on extensive surface interfaces and hydrogen bonding, most lipids have minimal hydrogen bonding potential and lack a substantial structural framework for stable interactions. As a result, even biologically relevant lipid-protein contacts may be too fleeting to detect under standard biochemical conditions.\nTo effectively identify and analyze lipid-binding proteins, it is necessary to stabilize these interactions in a way that allows their subsequent enrichment and detection. While affinity enrichment approaches (e.g., lipid pulldown assays) can be used, they often require detergents to solubilize membrane-associated complexes, which can introduce artifacts or disrupt weak lipid-protein interactions. Covalent crosslinking, on the other hand, offers a far more reliable method to “freeze” these interactions in place, preserving their native binding state even during rigorous purification steps before mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nWhy Use Diazirine as a Crosslinking Motif?\nSeveral chemical groups can be used for covalent crosslinking, but diazirine rings are particularly well-suited for lipid studies due to their small size and minimal structural interference. Other crosslinking devices are mostly aromatic and hence may alter the lipid’s physicochemical properties, potentially changing its location and interaction profile. Non-aromatic diazirine, however, is the smallest known photoactivatable crosslinking group, making it an ideal choice for studying delicate lipid-protein interactions.\n\n\nKey Properties of Diazirine Crosslinking:\nLipid interactions are typically transient, as most lipid backbones lack opportunities for strong hydrogen bonding and are too small to provide a significant binding interface. Identifying interacting proteins requires stabilizing these interactions to allow for enrichment and analysis. While affinity-based approaches can help, covalent crosslinking is the most effective method, as it enables the removal of impurities and detergents before mass spectrometry analysis.\nAmong the various crosslinking motifs, the diazirine ring is the smallest, making it the least likely to interfere with a lipid’s natural interactions. Still, the introduction of diazirine into a fatty acid side chain will slightly decrease hydrophobicity and lipid ordering. Upon exposure to 355 nm UV light, the diazirine ring forms a reactive intermediate, which rapidly form covalent bonds with nearby molecules. This reaction is highly versatile, as reactive intermediates such as carbenes can insert into nearby carbon-hydrogen, sulfur-hydrogen, nitrogen-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen, or double bonds, allowing for broad coverage of potential interaction partners1. Despite these numerous options, reaction with glutamate seems to be modestly preferred2. The small size and high reactivity of diazirine crosslinking make it an invaluable tool for capturing lipid-protein interactions while minimizing perturbations to native lipid function.\n\n\nThe Effect of Diazirine Placement on Crosslinking Targets\nThe reactive carbene produced upon irradiation will bond with whatever molecule is nearest – thus, the location of the diazirine ring can have a dramatic effect on what protein interactors are stabilized via crosslinking.\nThe majority of lipid analogs produced to date were synthesized with the diazirine ring near the terminal end of an acyl chain. For example, 8-3 Fatty Acid has diazirine on carbon 10 of the fatty acid. These lipid analogs may be expected to preferentially crosslink to proteins which penetrate far into the hydrophobic region between the leaflets of a membrane bilayer, such as transmembrane proteins.\nIn comparison, moving the diazirine ring closer to the hydrophilic headgroup may increase the partiality of crosslinking towards peripheral membrane proteins in addition to transmembrane proteins. An example of this shift is 1-10 Fatty Acid, in which the diazirine ring was diazirine on carbon 3 of the fatty acid.\nIncreasingly, lipid derivatives with the diazirine located on or near the lipid head group become available. Hence, many additions to the lipid interactome database now show interactions with proteins located at the membrane interface or cytosolic proteins. Future comparison of intramembrane versus membrane interface crosslinking will provide a more global view on lipid interactomes.\n\n\n\nTerminal Alkyne\nWhen studying proteins, researchers often use genetic methods to tag or modify them, making them easier to visualize or isolate. For example, adding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain to a protein allows it to be seen under a fluorescence microscope, whereas incorporating an HA tag enables enrichment using antibody pulldown techniques. These approaches work well for proteins because they are encoded by genes and can be modified at the DNA level.\nLipids, however, cannot be modified in the same way. Their synthesis occurs enzymatically, meaning there is no genetic sequence to alter. Large additions, like a GFP or HA domain, would drastically change a lipid’s properties, making it unrecognizable to the proteins and pathways that typically interact with it. Instead, a much smaller modification is needed—one that allows researchers to track and manipulate lipids without interfering with their biological function.\n\nA Versatile Bioorthogonal Handle\nOne of the smallest and most effective modifications for this purpose is the terminal alkyne. This functional group consists of a simple triple bond at the end of a carbon chain, a minor structural change that does not significantly alter the lipid’s behavior. Despite its small size, the terminal alkyne serves as a powerful chemical handle, allowing researchers to attach various probes after the lipid has been introduced into a biological system.\nThe terminal alkyne is particularly useful because it undergoes copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, the prototypical click chemistry reaction. This reaction is highly specific, rapid, and bio-orthogonal, meaning it does not produce reaction products with natural cellular molecules. . By reacting the alkyne with an azide-containing probe, researchers can introduce fluorescent markers for imaging or affinity tags for isolating lipid-protein complexes. The reaction requires catalysis by copper (I) ions and is therefore usually not suitable for intact cells and tissues but works well in fixed or lysed samples.\n\n\nApplications in Lipid Research\nBy providing a simple yet effective means of modifying lipids without disrupting their native properties, the terminal alkyne has become an essential tool in lipidomics and chemical biology. One major application of the terminal alkyne is fluorescence labeling. A functionalized lipid can be introduced into cells and later reacted with a fluorophore-conjugated, ideally fluorogenic, azide, allowing researchers to visualize the lipid’s location in fixed cells. By using pulse-chase experiments, lipid movement is also trackable.\nAnother important use is affinity-based enrichment. Lipids containing a terminal alkyne can be captured using azide-functionalized beads (or resins), enabling the isolation of lipid-protein complexes after photo-crosslinking for analysis by mass spectrometry. This method has been instrumental in identifying proteins that interact with specific lipid species, shedding light on lipid signaling pathways and metabolic networks. An alternative is to covalently attach biotin to the lipid-protein conjugates and the use of streptavidin beads to wash and isolate them.\n\n\n\nThe Photo-activatable Group (Cage)\nEssential roles of lipids in cellular signaling often rely on a transient abundance of lipid species, in some cases on the sub-minute scale. Hence, studying lipids in intact cells presents unique challenges due to their highly dynamic metabolism. Unlike proteins, which are relatively stable once synthesized, many bioactive lipids are continuously synthesized, modified, interconverted, and degraded as part of an extensive and tightly regulated lipid metabolic network. Even lipids so far not associated with cellular signaling show rapid turnover, which makes it difficult to study the effects of a specific lipid species in isolation, as a lipid of interest artificially introduced to cells may be enzymatically altered before it can exert its intended biological function.\nOne strategy to overcome this challenge is using photo-activatable (caged) lipid derivatives. These remain biologically inert until exposed to a specific wavelength of light. Irradiation releases the biologically active lipid derivative within seconds. Subcellular illumination allows researchers to control the timing and location of lipid levels, enabling targeted investigation of lipid function with high spatiotemporal resolution.\n\nA Light-Activated Protection Group\nThere is a limited but significant number of photo-activatable protecting groups that have been used successfully in biological experiments, One of the most effective tools for photocaging lipids is based on 7-diethylamino-4-methylene coumarin, a photolabile protection group that can be removed upon exposure to 405 nm light. When attached to a lipid’s headgroup, the coumarin moiety temporarily blocks interactions with proteins, preventing the lipid from participating in its normal biological pathways. Upon photoactivation, the coumarin group is removed via a fast radical-based mechanism, restoring the lipid to its native structure and allowing it to engage with its biological targets. Another advantage are the fluorescent properties of the caging group which permits monitoring of cell entry and cell location.\nOther photo-activatable groups include nitrobenzyl groups and Bodipy cages. The former often need shorter wavelengths for the (somewhat slower) photo-reaction. In addition, nitrobenzyl groups are not fluorescent and hence cannot not be used for following lipid derivative entry into cells. Bodipy cages have great photo-chemical properties and permit uncaging at longer wavelengths but add significantly more bulk to the lipid derivative.\nThis uncaging approach is very useful for studying lipid-protein interactions in intact cells and tissue where longer incubation times are needed, as uncaging the lipid in a controlled manner ensures that protein binders recognize the native lipid structure only when and where the researcher intends.\n\n\nApplications in Cellular Signaling Studies\nThe power of coumarin-caged lipids has been demonstrated in studies examining intracellular lipid signaling. For example, in 2015, Höglinger et al. used a caged sphingosine analog to investigate the role of sphingosine in calcium signaling. They found that upon photoactivation of the caged sphingosine, lysosomal calcium release was triggered, revealing a crucial link between sphingosine metabolism and intracellular calcium dynamics3. This discovery significantly expanded the understanding of the sphingosine signaling cascade and its downstream effects.\nBeyond biochemical studies, coumarin-caged lipids enable live-cell imaging approaches. Selectively irradiating specific subcellular regions allows the researcher to uncage lipids in a highly localized manner and assess their effects in real time. While this approach is not well-suited for large-scale proteomic studies, it provides a powerful method for investigating lipid function via fluorescence microscopy."

    "text": "Limitations of multi-functionalized lipid probes\n\nWhile significant effort has minimized the effect that each modification has on the biophysical properties of the lipid analogs, it remains the case that adding a diazirine and a terminal alkyne will necessarily affect their physical properties – perhaps affecting sub-cellular localization and binding.\nThe coumarin cage has been repeatedly shown to protect lipid analogs from premature metabolism, but it should be recognized that this comes with some distinct changes to the behavior of the native lipid.\n\nFor example, when a cell is exposed to a photocaged lipid probe, the probe intercalates predominantly to endomembranes even if the native lipid is known to reside in the plasma membrane, as was shown for PIP3. This may lead to the identification of non-biologically-relevant hits or require enough time for lipid translocation after uncaging.\n\nSimilarly, the diazirine and alkyne groups may have minor effects on the biophysical properties of the lipid probe as it interacts with other lipids and proteins within the membrane bilayer. This may be more relevant for proteins which preferentially bind to the acyl chain.\n\nFor example, some work has been done to demonstrate that the placement of the diazirine ring along the length of the acyl chain can have impacts on the interactome of the lipid probe4. Farley et al (2024) demonstrated this using trifunctional fatty acid probes by placing the diazirine either 3 carbons from the terminus (8-3 FA) or 10 carbons from the terminus (1-10 FA). They identified several proteins with distinct enrichment profiles, including VDAC1 and VDAC2 (which are preferentially enriched to the 8-3 FA probe), and ACAD9 and UBB (which are preferentially enriched to the 1-10 FA probe).\n\nQuantification of +UV versus -UV\n\nThe details of the quantitative mass spectrometry are described in our Overview of Proteomics Methods. However, we hope to succinctly describe that quantitative mass spectrometry techniques necessarily require normalization at sample input level – thereby exaggerating the abundance of proteins in the -UV control samples.\nIt should be noted, therefore, that there is little meaning to a protein which is “enriched” toward the -UV condition. For this reason, all proteins which are “depleted” following irradiation with UV have been designated as “no hit” in most of the analyses."

We interpreted several throughlines in their comments: 1. Requests for additional metadata about study methodology and the incorporation of additional data (e.g. accession numbers in addition to gene names), 2. Requests for additional information about data submission, processing, and harmonization methods, 3. Requests for an automated/scalable data submission pipeline, and 4. The identification of typographical errors, malformed links, and bugs in the site.\nMany of these points have been addressed directly either in the text or on the Lipid Interactome repository. For example, the broken links and typographical errors in figure captions have been addressed, additional cell line information has been added to our Comparing the Enriched Hits of Different Probes Shiny app, we have included of accession number to convey crucial information about isoform identifications in addition to using gene name to identify hits (where possible in the original datasets; the authors of Hoglinger 2017 have been unresponsive and we do not have the accession number data for their results) and clarification about the qualitative nature of the comparisons displayed in the Shiny app. We have additionally provided links to download the R scripts which were used to “wrangle” the submitted data to the formats that our data visualization functions accept.\nWe highly concur with the reviewers’ request for an automated data submission system. At present, this site has been built, managed, and maintained through the efforts of a single individual and we do not currently have the resources to overhaul the site to sufficiently incorporate these needs; we are seeking additional funding from the Open Oregon Educational Resources and the Code for Science and Society programs to support this individual in building these functionalities into our site. It is a long-term vision of our group to build a more scalable version of this repository which requires minimal manual management and enables automated data submission. However, we further feel that the underlying architecture of this repository is independent of its utility to the external lipid research community.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome.

What little attention NAPE has received has been devoted to understanding its metabolic functions as a precursor to N-acylethanolamine (NAE), a bioactive lipid that acts as an endocannabinoid. Yet, levels of NAPE increase during myocardial infarction and ischemia, suggesting potential signaling roles for this lipid. Here, we exploit photoaffinity labeling (PAL) to identify NAPE-interacting proteins and elucidate signaling functions of NAPE. By positioning diazirine and alkyne groups in metabolically distinct regions of the NAPE molecule, we ensured that our PAL probe reported on interactions of NAPE and not NAE. Our studies identified several NAPE interactors, including two single-pass transmembrane proteins, CD147/Basigin and CD44, both of which serve as chaperones for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) from the SLC16A family that mediate lactate flux across the plasma membrane. Functional studies revealed that NAPE stimulates lactate efflux by MCTs dependent upon CD147 and CD44, establishing NAPE as a bona fide signaling lipid and pointing to potential physiological roles in metabolic and energy homeostasis that may be pathologically relevant in ischemia.\n\n\n\nBifunctional NAPE   \n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\n\nLEI-401\n30 min\n60 min\n30 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSILAC\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\nData as submitted by the original authors was not normalized.

We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo-crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo-crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.\n\n\n\nTrifunctional PI(3,4,5)P3\n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\nPeptide spectral counting (in original publication)\nLabel free quantification (as reported here, enabled via fresh analysis by Frank Stein, EMBL – details below)\n\n\n\nSamples were split into membrane and cytosolic fractions and analyzed as independent mass spec samples. Additional No Probe controls were included for raw input, though not used in displaying the data on this site.\n\n\n\nThe authors of this paper were unable to provide the original results of their dataset, and we applied a label-free quantification data pipeline to their mass spectrometry files, publicly-available on ProteomExchange\nFor this analysis, raw protein intensities were processed by first selecting unique proteins supported by at least two razor peptides. Batch effects were then removed, and missing values were imputed using a hybrid strategy: KNN imputation was applied to high-confidence proteins with replicate-level missingness, while low-confidence proteins were assigned minimum detected values (MinDet). The data were subsequently variance-stabilized and normalized, after which differential abundance testing was performed using the limma framework. Parallel analyses were also carried out with the fdrtool package, with significance thresholds defined consistently across methods. Proteins were classified according to standard criteria: hits (FDR &lt; 0.05 and |fold-change| &gt; 1.5), candidates (FDR &lt; 0.2 and |fold-change| &gt; 1.5), enriched candidates (FDR &lt; 0.2 and fold-change &gt; 1.5), enriched hits (FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold-change &gt; 1.5), and all others as non-significant.\n\n\n\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download",

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Diacylglycerol   \nTrifunctional 8-3 Fatty Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\nSpecies: Homo sapiens\nCell type: Epithelial (immortalized cervical cancer line)\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n5 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\nDAG\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n8-3 FA\n15 min\n2.5 min\n0 min\n2.5 min\n\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting\n\n\n\n\n*PSM data presentation still in development.\nSee Höglinger et al. 2017 for results in context with Diacylglycerol and 8-3 Fatty Acid data.",

A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity‐based proximity labelling and identification of GPI‐interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI‐cell membrane interaction. Eighty‐eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI‐anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI‐related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nBifunctional Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (bf-GPI)\nBifunctional phosphatidyl moiety with &-D-glucoside (Control)\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nbf-GPI\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\nControl\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPrecursor ion intensity Label Free Quantitation (LFQ), performed using Proteome Discoverer\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotsRanked-order plotsMA Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Kundu et al., 2024.

While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses.

The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes.

This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\n\nTrifunctional Sphingosine   \nTrifunctional Sphinganine   \n\n\n\nHuh7\nSpecies: Homo sapiens\nCell type: hepatocyte derived cellular carcinoma cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nSph\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\nSpa\n60 min\n5 min\n15 min\n5 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download"

A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity‐based proximity labelling and identification of GPI‐interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI‐cell membrane interaction. Eighty‐eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI‐anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI‐related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nBifunctional Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (bf-GPI)\nBifunctional phosphatidyl moiety with &-D-glucoside (Control)\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\nSpecies: Homo sapiens\nCell type: Epithelial (immortalized cervical cancer line)\n\n\n\nUncaging & Crosslinking timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid Probe\nUptake time\nUncaging time\nInteraction time\nCrosslinking time\n\n\n\n\nbf-GPI\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\nControl\n180 min\nNA\nNA\n15 min\n\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPrecursor ion intensity Label Free Quantitation (LFQ), performed using Proteome Discoverer\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\nData wrangling\nUse the download button below to download the R script used to wrangle the authors’ original submission into the data visualization tools on the Lipid Interactome:\n Download \nUse the download button below to download the original data file prior to wrangling:\n Download \n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

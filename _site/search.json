    "text": "Abstract\nPhosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a ubiquitous lipid species in higher eukaryotes which resides preferentially in mitochondria. Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use.",

    "text": "Abstract\nFunctions of the sphingolipids sphingosine and sphinganine in cells are not well established. While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.",

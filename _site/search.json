Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome. A trifunctional phosphatidic acid (PA) derivative in compari-son was rapidly metabolized and is hence more limited in its use.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nPhosphatidic Acid   \nPhosphatidic Acid   \n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange details\n\n\n\n\n\nProteomeXchange title: Trifunctional lipid derivatives: PEâ€™s mi-tochondrial interactome\nProteomeXchange accession: PXD059960\nPubMed ID: Not applicable\nPublication DOI: 10.1039/D4CC03599B\nProject Webpage: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD059960\nFTP Download: https://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2025/01/PXD059960\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\n\nVolcano plotsRanked-order plotsMA PlotData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Thomas et al., 2025.

Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain their utility have not been thoroughly described. Here, we synthesize three palmitic acid derivatives with a diazirine at different positions on the acyl chain and examine their metabolism, subcellular localization, and protein interactions. We demonstrate that while they produce very similar metabolites and subcellular distributions, probes with the diazirine at either end pulldown distinct subsets of proteins after photo-crosslinking.

We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo-crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins.

    "text": "Introduction: Why Study Lipid Interactomes?\nAt its core, biology is a complex network of chemical interactions. Every biological process—from metabolism to signaling—depends on the physical interactions between molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. While proteins have long been the primary focus of interaction studies, lipids play an equally crucial yet often underappreciated role in cellular function.\n\nLipid-Lipid Interactions and Membrane Properties\nLipids are primarily organized within membrane bilayers, where their interactions define critical membrane properties such as rigidity, fluidity, and resistance to detergents. By studying lipid-lipid interactomes, researchers can gain deeper insight into how these physical interactions influence membrane architecture and dynamics. Understanding these interactions is essential for unraveling fundamental processes like vesicle trafficking, cell signaling, and membrane compartmentalization.\n\n\nLipids as Signaling Molecules\nBeyond their structural roles, many lipids have been increasingly recognized as key signaling molecules. For example, the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a pivotal role in immune function. S1P binds to a specific family of receptors, triggering T cell migration (extravasation) and guiding their movement toward sites of infection. This highlights how lipid signaling can affect cellular behavior and physiological responses.\n\n\nLipid-Protein Interactions: Unlocking Cellular Communication\nA single lipid species can interact with a diverse array of proteins, influencing everything from receptor activation to intracellular signaling cascades. Mapping these lipid-protein interactions provides a powerful approach to understanding how lipids exert their wide-ranging effects on cellular processes. By deciphering lipid interactomes, researchers can uncover novel regulatory mechanisms and potentially identify new therapeutic targets in diseases where lipid signaling is dysregulated."

    "text": "Synthetic Lipid Analogs: Powerful Tools for Lipid Biology\nThe study of lipid biology has been greatly advanced by synthetic lipid analogs. However, it may not be immediately clear why such analogs are essential. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, lipids present unique challenges that make traditional genetic tools less effective in studying their function.\n\nWhy Lipids Require a Different Approach\nAdvances in genetic engineering—such as CRISPR and de novo gene synthesis—have revolutionized the study of nucleic acids and proteins. These techniques enable precise modifications, such as altering enzyme activity, redirecting proteins to different subcellular locations, modifying binding domains, and tagging proteins for visualization or isolation.\nIn contrast, lipids present unique challenges that make genetic approaches impractical. Unlike proteins, which are directly encoded in DNA, lipids are synthesized enzymatically. Their structures cannot be modified in living cells through genetic manipulation alone. Traditional approaches, such as gene knockouts or knock-ins, can broadly alter lipid composition but do not allow for precise control over individual lipid species.\nLipids are also much smaller than proteins, often composed of just a few dozen atoms. Even minor modifications can significantly alter their biophysical properties and biological function. Unlike proteins, which can tolerate the addition of large fluorescent or affinity tags, lipids require minimal chemical modifications to preserve their activity.\nAdditionally, lipids exist within a highly dynamic metabolic network, where they are continuously synthesized, modified, and degraded. Some signaling lipids, such as sphingosine, have extremely short half-lives—sometimes only minutes—making them difficult to track in real-time.\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have developed synthetic lipid analogs with chemical modifications that allow for targeted investigation while preserving essential biological properties. The following sections detail key modifications used in functional lipid probes.\n\n\nThe Role of Synthetic Lipid Analogs\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have developed synthetic analogs of native lipids. These modified lipids allow for precise investigation of lipid function while preserving their essential biological properties. The key modifications used in this approach include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiazirine ring\n\n\n\n\n\nLipid-protein interactions are inherently transient and dynamic, making them particularly challenging to capture and study. Unlike protein-protein interactions, which often rely on extensive surface interfaces and hydrogen bonding, most lipids have minimal hydrogen bonding potential and lack a substantial structural framework for stable interactions. As a result, even biologically relevant lipid-protein contacts may be too fleeting to detect under standard biochemical conditions.\nTo effectively identify and analyze lipid-binding proteins, it is necessary to stabilize these interactions in a way that allows their subsequent enrichment and detection. While affinity enrichment approaches (e.g., lipid pulldown assays) can be used, they often require detergents to solubilize membrane-associated complexes, which can introduce artifacts or disrupt weak lipid-protein interactions. Covalent crosslinking, on the other hand, offers a far more reliable method to “freeze” these interactions in place, preserving their native binding state even during rigorous purification steps before mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nWhy Use Diazirine as a Crosslinking Motif?\nSeveral chemical groups can be used for covalent crosslinking, but diazirine rings are particularly well-suited for lipid studies due to their small size and minimal structural interference. Other crosslinking motifs may alter the lipid’s physicochemical properties, potentially changing its interaction profile. Diazirine, however, is the smallest known photoactivatable crosslinking group, making it an ideal choice for studying delicate lipid-protein interactions.\n\n\nKey properties of diazirine crosslinking:\nLipid interactions are typically transient, as most lipids lack opportunities for strong hydrogen bonding and are too small to provide a significant binding interface. Identifying interacting proteins requires stabilizing these interactions to allow for enrichment and analysis. While affinity-based approaches can help, covalent crosslinking is the most effective method, as it enables the removal of impurities and detergents before mass spectrometry analysis.\nAmong the various crosslinking motifs, the diazirine ring is the smallest, making it the least likely to interfere with a lipid’s natural interactions. Upon exposure to 355 nm UV light, the diazirine ring forms a reactive carbene radical, which rapidly covalently bonds with nearby molecules. This reaction is highly versatile, as the carbene can insert into carbon-hydrogen, sulfur-hydrogen, nitrogen-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen, or double bonds, allowing for broad coverage of potential interaction partners[@haberkantFatFabulousBifunctional2014].\nThe small size and high reactivity of diazirine crosslinking make it an invaluable tool for capturing lipid-protein interactions while minimizing perturbations to native lipid function.\n\n\nThe effect of Diazirine placement on crosslinking targets\n\nThe reactive carbene produced upon irradiation will bond with whatever molecule is nearest – thus, the location of the diazirine ring can have a dramatic effect on what protein interactors are stabilized via crosslinking.\nThe majority of lipid analogs produced to date were synthesized with the diazirine ring near the terminal end of an acyl chain. For example, 8-3 Fatty Acid has the acyl chain only 3 carbons from the end. These lipid analogs may be expected to preferentially crosslink to proteins which penetrate far into the hydrophobic region between the leaflets of a membrane bilayer, such as transmembrane proteins.\nIn comparison, moving the diazirine ring closer to the hydrophilic headgroup may increase the partiality of crosslinking towards peripheral membrane proteins in addition to transmembrane proteins. An example of this shift is 1-10 Fatty Acid, in which the diazirine ring was placed 10 carbons from the terminus of the chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal Alkyne\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen studying proteins, researchers often use genetic methods to tag or modify them, making them easier to visualize or isolate. For example, adding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain to a protein allows it to be seen under a fluorescence microscope, whereas incorporating an HA tag enables enrichment using antibody pulldown techniques. These approaches work well for proteins because they are encoded by genes and can be modified at the DNA level.\nLipids, however, cannot be modified in the same way. Their synthesis occurs enzymatically, meaning there is no genetic sequence to alter. Large additions, like a GFP or HA domain, would drastically change a lipid’s properties, making it unrecognizable to the proteins and pathways that typically interact with it. Instead, a much smaller modification is needed—one that allows researchers to track and manipulate lipids without interfering with their biological function.\n\nA Versatile Bioorthogonal Handle\nOne of the smallest and most effective modifications for this purpose is the terminal alkyne. This functional group consists of a simple triple bond at the end of a carbon chain, a minor structural change that does not significantly alter the lipid’s behavior. Despite its small size, the terminal alkyne serves as a powerful chemical handle, allowing researchers to attach various probes after the lipid has been introduced into a biological system.\nThe terminal alkyne is particularly useful because it undergoes azide-alkyne cycloaddition, a type of click chemistry reaction. This reaction is highly specific, rapid, and bio-orthogonal, meaning it does not interfere with natural cellular processes. By reacting the alkyne with an azide-containing probe, researchers can introduce fluorescent markers for imaging or affinity tags for isolating lipid-protein complexes.\n\n\nApplications in Lipid Research\nOne major application of the terminal alkyne is fluorescence labeling. A functionalized lipid can be introduced into cells and later reacted with a fluorophore-conjugated azide, allowing researchers to visualize its distribution and movement under a microscope. This approach provides insights into lipid localization and trafficking.\nAnother important use is affinity-based enrichment. Lipids containing a terminal alkyne can be captured using azide-functionalized beads, enabling the isolation of lipid-protein complexes for analysis by mass spectrometry. This method has been instrumental in identifying proteins that interact with specific lipid species, shedding light on lipid signaling pathways and metabolic networks.\nBy providing a simple yet effective means of modifying lipids without disrupting their native properties, the terminal alkyne has become an essential tool in lipidomics and chemical biology. It bridges the gap between traditional lipid research and modern bioorthogonal chemistry, allowing for precise studies of lipid function in living systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoumarin Photocage\n\n\n\n\n\nLipids play an essential role in cellular signaling, yet their biological study presents unique challenges due to their highly dynamic metabolism. Unlike proteins, which are relatively stable once synthesized, many bioactive lipids are continuously synthesized, modified, interconverted, and degraded as part of an extensive and tightly regulated lipid metabolic network. This rapid turnover makes it difficult to study the effects of a specific lipid species in isolation, as the lipid of interest may be enzymatically altered before it can exert its intended biological function.\nOne strategy to overcome this challenge is using photocaged lipid analogs, which remain biologically inert until exposed to a specific wavelength of light. Irradiation with this wavelength “uncages” the analog to reveal its native structure. This allows researchers to control the timing and location of lipid activation, enabling targeted investigation of lipid function with high spatiotemporal resolution.\n\nA Light-Activated Protection Group\nOne of the most effective tools for photocaging lipids is the coumarin cage, a photolabile protection group that can be removed upon exposure to 400 nm light. When attached to a lipid’s headgroup, the coumarin moiety temporarily blocks interactions with proteins, preventing the lipid from participating in its normal biological pathways. However, upon photoactivation, the coumarin group is cleaved, restoring the lipid to its native structure and allowing it to engage with its biological targets.\nThis approach is useful for studying lipid-protein interactions, as uncaging the lipid in a controlled manner ensures that protein binders recognize the native lipid structure only when and where the researcher intends.\n\n\nApplications in Cellular Signaling Studies\nThe power of coumarin-caged lipids has been demonstrated in studies examining intracellular lipid signaling. For example, in 2015, Högliner et al. used a caged sphingosine analog to investigate the role of sphingosine in calcium signaling. They found that upon photoactivation of the caged sphingosine, lysosomal calcium release was triggered, revealing a crucial link between sphingosine metabolism and intracellular calcium dynamics1. This discovery significantly expanded the understanding of the sphingosine signaling cascade and its downstream effects.\nBeyond biochemical studies, coumarin-caged lipids enable live-cell imaging approaches. Selectively irradiating specific subcellular regions allows the researcher to uncage lipids in a highly localized manner and assess their effects in real time. While this approach is not well-suited for large-scale proteomic studies, it provides a powerful method for investigating lipid function via fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nAn Additional Benefit: Coumarin’s Inherent Fluorescence\nA unique advantage of using coumarin as a photocaging group is its intrinsic fluorescence. This means that before the lipid is even uncaged, its cellular incorporation can be directly visualized using a fluorescence microscope. By tracking fluorescence intensity and distribution, researchers can quickly determine whether a functionalized lipid has successfully intercalated into the target cell’s membrane or accumulated in specific subcellular compartments.\nThis dual functionality—serving as both a caging group and a fluorescent probe—makes coumarin a useful tool for studying lipid localization, uptake, and bioactivity.\n\n\n\n\nThese modifications stabilize protein-lipid interactions and enable the selective enrichment of lipid-bound proteins, all while maintaining tight spatial and temporal control. Each of these tools is described in further detail below."

Instead, it relies on comparing the summed intensity of detected peptides across different samples analyzed under identical conditions.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPeptide Detection (MS1): Peptides are isolated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nPeptide Sequencing (MS2): Selected peptide ions are fragmented, and the resulting spectra determine peptide sequences.\nQuantification: The total signal intensity of all identified peptides corresponding to a protein is summed as a proxy for its abundance.\nComparison Across Samples: Samples prepared and analyzed using the same LC-MS/MS protocol can be compared using peptide-spectrum match (PSM) counts as an abundance proxy.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Label-Free Quantification\n\nCost-Effective & Simple Sample Preparation: Unlike labeling methods (e.g., TMT), LFQ does not require expensive reagents or complex modifications, making it more accessible.\nFlexible & Widely Used: Compatible with various experimental designs and allows for comparisons across many samples without multiplexing constraints.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nPotential Bias from Co-Elution: High-abundance peptides can overshadow low-abundance ones, reducing the number of reliably quantified peptides.\nRun-to-Run Variability: LFQ requires separate MS runs for each sample, making it susceptible to differences in instrument calibration, chromatography conditions, or sample handling. Careful quality control is necessary to minimize artificial differences.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nLabel-free quantification is a practical and widely used method for proteomics research. While cost-effective and flexible, its accuracy depends on careful experimental design and quality control to reduce variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Mass Spectrometry with Tandem Mass Tagging\n\n\n\n\n\nTandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling is a powerful quantitative mass spectrometry technique that enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in a single MS run. This approach improves efficiency and allows for precise relative quantification of proteins across experimental conditions.\n\nHow It Works\n\nChemical Labeling: Each sample is chemically tagged with a unique TMT label, which consists of a reactive group binding to peptides and a mass reporter for sample differentiation.\nSample Pooling: Labeled samples are combined into a single pooled group, reducing the need for separate MS runs.\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\n\nMS1 (Peptide Isolation): Peptides are separated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nMS2 (Peptide Sequencing & Tag Fragmentation): Peptides are fragmented for sequence identification, and TMT mass tags fragment to generate reporter ions.\n\nQuantification: The intensity of reporter ions reveals the relative abundance of peptides across the original samples.\nComparison Across Samples: Within a TMT cassette (typically 16 samples), relative protein abundance is calculated from the reporter ion intensities. A pooled control channel enables comparison across cassettes, allowing up to 30 samples to be analyzed in a single experiment.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of TMT Labeling\n\nIncreased Throughput & Efficiency: Enables multiplexing of many samples (e.g., 16 or more), reducing the number of separate MS runs.\nDeeper Proteome Coverage: Pooled samples can be fractionated (e.g., by cation exchange chromatography), enhancing detection of low-abundance peptides.\nImproved Quantification Accuracy: Since all samples are analyzed in the same MS run, technical variability between runs is minimized.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nHigher Cost: TMT reagents and high-end mass spectrometers add to the expense.\nComplex Sample Preparation: Requires additional steps for labeling, pooling, and fractionation, increasing the risk of sample handling variability.\nNormalization Requirement: Accurate quantification requires equal protein input across samples to avoid artificial balancing biases.\nDemanding Instrumentation & Expertise: Requires high-resolution mass spectrometers, often necessitating specialized facilities.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nTMT-based mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for large-scale proteomics, offering high-throughput, precise, and deep proteome coverage. While it requires advanced instrumentation and careful sample preparation, its ability to multiplex multiple samples in a single run makes it an attractive option for high-confidence protein quantification."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the biological roles that lipids play have garnered significant attention. While analyses of protein::protein interactions using proteomics has become nearly routine, it was very nearly impossible to assess the protein interactors of lipids because of their small size and sensitive biophysical properties. However, the advent of synthetic, multifunctionalized lipid analogs (lipid probes) has the potential to spur a revolution in the study of bioactive lipids. Numerous studies have reported the “interactome” of select lipid species using these lipid probes, though no resource to date has amassed these results for centralized comparison. We present here the LipidInteractome repository as a tool to enable lipid biologists to explore and compare the protein interactors of a variety of biologically interesting lipids.\nThis growing family of multifunctionalized lipid probes incorporates two to three of the following synthetic chemical additions: (1) A diazirine ring, which enables photoactivatable crosslinking to stabilize lipid::protein interactions upon irradiation with 355 nm light; (2) A terminal alkyne, which enables post-hoc azide cycloaddition (click chemistry) to affix an affinity handle for enrichment; and (3) A coumarin photocage, which protects the lipid analog from premature enzymatic modification until the sample is irradiated with 405 nm light (present only in the so-called “trifunctional” lipid probes)1–3.\nPreviously, there was no centralized repository for lipid interactions data. This database enables comparative analysis of the interactomes of these lipid probes, significantly reducing the barriers to target selection for researchers who seek to explore the signaling roles that lipids such as sphingosine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and diacylglycerol play throughout the cell.\nThis repository serves as a centralized point for access, interactive exploration, and download of publicly-available proteomics datasets utilizing multifunctionalized lipid analogs to identify the protein interactors of select bioactive lipids. At present, analyses of trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingosine, and sphinganine are presented in our repository, with the interactomes of either HeLa or Huh7 cells3,4. Additionally, we have presented the results of two fatty acid probes which serves as a control for non-specific lipid-binding proteins5."

The R scripts which define the rendered figures is embedded in the source material for each page.\nAn interactive discovery platform intended to guide lipid research\nContains data from 5 studies thus far, though framework for expanding to many more.\nEnables the direct comparison of different studies, and is an invaluable addition to the understanding of how proteins interact with lipids\nThe site is a living document and is expected to grow as future studies utilize these functionalized lipid analogs. We have prepared a Data Submission page for any researchers with similar datasets who wish to contribute to this repository.\n\n\n\nFAIR data principles\n\nFindable: We sought to create a platform to centralize the studies of this type. The site is organized such that one can interact with the results of individual published studies or explore the combined results of all studies which investigated a given lipid. Because this site is a living document, we invite researchers to contribute their results by contacting us with the details delineated at our Data Submission page.\nAccessible: To enhance the accessibility of these data, we have made the results of all studies and lipid probes downloadable in .csv format. We have provided a detailed overview of the data production and analysis, a description of the content in all columns, and a nuanced discussion about the limitations of these probes. To maximize the reliability of each reported interactome, we have focused on amassing only peer-reviewed proteomics results.\nInteroperable: We have sought to coordinate the formatting of the data collected from a variety of research teams. While many studies utilized identical data analysis pipelines, some of our included publications used distinct mass spectrometry protocols and we have attempted to provide a parallel data structure and visualization – while also explaining the differences in methodology.\nReusable: We have provided extensive documentation on the production, analyses, and caveats of these data; in these documentations, we have sought to limit technical language and to give these results an accessible interpretation. Additionally, we have referenced numerous publications which go into much greater depth on the synthesis of these lipid probes and the methodology used in each proteomics analysis.\n\n\n\nA summary of the data vis/download modules\n\nEach study which produced data depicted on this site has a dedicated page in which the user can explore the results published therein. This includes Volcano, Ranked-Order, and MA plots to visualize the probes reported. These plots were built using the R packages plotly and htmlwidgets to enable interactive exploration of these data[REF plotly and htmlwidgets]. Additionally, the entirety of the data reported can be downloaded.\nThe data from each study was then broken into the composite lipid probes – these data are depicted on respectively-named lipid probe pages. Each probe page contains information about the contributing studies and is partitioned by cell type analyzed. In the future, we intend to enable the user to perform comparisons between the interactomes of different cell types with the same lipid probe.\nWhere similar study design allows, data is incorporated into a Shiny app for interactive selection of probes for exploration at Probe vs Probe Comparisons. These plots incorporate linear regression analysis to describe the similarity of the datasets, and highlight proteins which were significantly enriched in one or the other dataset – or in both datasets. We seek for this functionality to enable researchers to identify targets of interest when studying bioactive lipids."

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\n\nSphingosine\nDiacylglycerol\n8-3 Fatty acid\n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\nPeptide spectral counting",

This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHuh7\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\n16-channel Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT16)\n\n\nAdditional sample preparation ?\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcano plotRanked order plotMA PlotsData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData as reported in Farley et al., 2024(B).

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nSphingosine\nDiacylglycerol\n8-3 Fatty acid\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting",

    "text": "Maintenance\n\nBasic overview\nThis site was built using Quarto. This is a form of R Markdown that is highly documented, and one can learn how to modify this site here: https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nThe overarching formatting of the site is controlled within the _quarto.yml file. Here one can update the site theme from the array of Bootswatch themes, or if you’re feeling ambitious you can design your own theme.\nWhen making updates to the site, one first edits/makes a file, then you use the Bash command “quarto render”. This will update the site directory within the _site folder. There are a lot of ways to do the editing, but it’s nicest to use the IDE Visual Studio Code because there’s a terminal in-window and you can see nice previews of what the site will look like without leaving the program.\n\n\nGitHub repository\nAfter changes are made to the .qmd files and then rendered, the changes can then be pushed to the GitHub repository: git@github.com:gaelenDG/LipidInteractomics_Website.git. Netlify will pull the changes and automatically deploy the updated site! See site owners for Netlify login information and .git access.\nCloning the GitHub repository should be sufficient for gaining access to all of the files in this website - though collaborators will need to be added manually by Gaelen, the repository administrator. More details will go here once a more formal pull request workflow is in place!\n\n\nQuarto formatting\nI have found that Quarto is highly documented and it’s pretty easy to figure out how to format or change the way things look (if all else fails, ask ChatGPT and you usually get a pretty good answer).\nAs a reference to help get you started, I very much appreciated this blog post by Richard Posert about using Quarto.\nI honestly get the most confused when it comes to formatting the _quarto.yml file because there aren’t many fully-fleshed examples out there for all the options. This is where I’ve (embarrassingly) leaned on ChatGPT for help – it’s not always right, but it’s usually close enough that you can make it work properly anyways.\nIf you want to add a page, you need to make a new .qmd file in the proper subfolder and render it as an .html file (conveniently, the Preview button in VS Code does that for you, but you can use whatever IDE you want). Then you need to add two lines to the .yml file so that the page is properly linked on the sidebar or navbar (first the href to denote the file path to the .html file, then the text to display on the page) – if you don’t add these, the page will remain unlinked and you’ll need to know the whole URL to find it (like this maintenance page).\nIf your data looks at all like Alix’s or Scotty’s, the ggplot functions I built in the ggplot_styles.R file will apply. Call the RankedOrderPlotStandard(), VolcanoPlotStandardized(), and MAStandard() functions to produce these plots with the same standardized formatting. On that note, you can alter the ggplot_styles.R file to change the standardized formatting.\nThere are a ton of things you can do within html divs, but I haven’t dipped my toes in those yet - use these to finely adjust how elements of each page look.\nIn order to make sure the author information is identical on all appropriate pages, I made an “include” folder with each study included thus far. This enables you to call the same study information on each probe/study page without worrying that they’re somehow different."

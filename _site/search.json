    "text": "Maintenance\n\nBasic overview\nThis site was built using Quarto. This is a form of R Markdown that is highly documented, and one can learn how to modify this site here: https://quarto.org/docs/websites.\nThe overarching formatting of the site is controlled within the _quarto.yml file. Here one can update the site theme from the array of Bootswatch themes, or if you’re feeling ambitious you can design your own theme.\nWhen making updates to the site, one first edits/makes a file, then you use the Bash command “quarto render”. This will update the site directory within the _site folder. There are a lot of ways to do the editing, but it’s nicest to use the IDE Visual Studio Code because there’s a terminal in-window and you can see nice previews of what the site will look like without leaving the program.\n\n\nGitHub repository\nAfter changes are made to the .qmd files and then rendered, the changes can then be pushed to the GitHub repository: git@github.com:gaelenDG/LipidInteractomics_Website.git. Netlify will pull the changes and automatically deploy the updated site! See site owners for Netlify login information and .git access.\nCloning the GitHub repository should be sufficient for gaining access to all of the files in this website - though collaborators will need to be added manually by Gaelen, the repository administrator. More details will go here once a more formal pull request workflow is in place!\n\n\nQuarto formatting\nI have found that Quarto is highly documented and it’s pretty easy to figure out how to format or change the way things look (if all else fails, ask ChatGPT and you usually get a pretty good answer).\nAs a reference to help get you started, I very much appreciated this blog post by Richard Posert about using Quarto.\nI honestly get the most confused when it comes to formatting the _quarto.yml file because there aren’t many fully-fleshed examples out there for all the options. This is where I’ve (embarrassingly) leaned on ChatGPT for help – it’s not always right, but it’s usually close enough that you can make it work properly anyways.\nIf you want to add a page, you need to make a new .qmd file in the proper subfolder and render it as an .html file (conveniently, the Preview button in VS Code does that for you, but you can use whatever IDE you want). Then you need to add two lines to the .yml file so that the page is properly linked on the sidebar or navbar (first the href to denote the file path to the .html file, then the text to display on the page) – if you don’t add these, the page will remain unlinked and you’ll need to know the whole URL to find it (like this maintenance page).\nIf your data looks at all like Alix’s or Scotty’s, the ggplot functions I built in the ggplot_styles.R file will apply. Call the RankedOrderPlotStandard(), VolcanoPlotStandardized(), and MAStandard() functions to produce these plots with the same standardized formatting. On that note, you can alter the ggplot_styles.R file to change the standardized formatting.\nThere are a ton of things you can do within html divs, but I haven’t dipped my toes in those yet - use these to finely adjust how elements of each page look.\nIn order to make sure the author information is identical on all appropriate pages, I made an “include” folder with each study included thus far. This enables you to call the same study information on each probe/study page without worrying that they’re somehow different."

Investigations of the complex underlying mechanisms are difficult because several different methods need to be used under varying conditions. Here we introduce multifunctional lipid derivatives to study lipid metabolism, lipid−protein interactions, and intracellular lipid localization with a single tool per target lipid. The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo–cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann−Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools. We envision that this type of probe will become important for analyzing and ultimately understanding lipid signaling events in a comprehensive manner.\n\n\nLipid probes utilized\nSphingosine\nDiacylglycerol\n8-3 Fatty acid\n\n\nCell line analyzed\nHeLa\n\n\nMass spectrometry quantification method\nPeptide spectral counting",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nLipids are more than passive structural components of cellular membranes—they are active participants in signaling pathways, cellular homeostasis, organellar communications, and membrane dynamics. Despite their critical biological roles, lipid–protein interactions have historically been challenging to study. The small size and biophysical properties of lipids make conventional proteomics approaches unsuitable for mapping their interactors. Unlike proteins, which can be readily tagged or immobilized for affinity-based interaction studies, lipids require specialized chemical modifications to enable selective and controlled interaction profiling.\nRecent advances in developing multifunctionalized lipid analogs have revolutionized the field, enabling the systematic interrogation of lipid interactomes. These probes incorporate strategically designed functional groups that enable covalent crosslinking, affinity enrichment, and controlled activation. Most commonly, these include: (1) a diazirine ring for photoactivatable crosslinking upon exposure to 355 nm ultraviolet (UV) light, stabilizing lipid–protein interactions; (2) a terminal alkyne, permitting click chemistry-based enrichment; and, in some cases, (3) a coumarin photocage, which shields the lipid probe from premature enzymatic modification until selectively released by 405 nm light. Together, these modifications enable direct proteomic identification of lipid interactors, distinguishing true binding partners from transient or non-specific associations1–3.\nSeveral studies have already employed these lipid probes to elucidate the interactomes of key bioactive lipids, including diacylglycerol, sphingosine, sphinganine, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylethanolamine3–6. These studies have followed a comparative proteomics workflow, wherein crosslinked (“+UV”) and non-crosslinked (“-UV”) samples are analyzed side by side to minimize artifacts and confirm specificity1,2. However, despite the growing number of lipid interactome datasets, no centralized resource has existed to compile, compare, and standardize these findings.\nTo address this gap, we present the Lipid Interactome database – a curated repository designed to facilitate the comparative analysis of lipid–protein interactions from multiple studies. This resource consolidates proteomics data from multifunctional lipid probes, enabling researchers to efficiently explore and contextualize lipid-binding proteins across different lipid species and cellular models. Currently, the repository hosts interactomes derived from trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingosine, and sphinganine in HeLa and Huh7 cells3,6. Additionally, it includes control datasets from two fatty acid probes to distinguish specific from non-specific lipid-binding proteins5.\nBy providing a centralized platform for lipid interactome data, the Lipid Interactome significantly lowers the barriers to entry for researchers investigating lipid signaling pathways. This repository represents a necessary step toward systematizing lipid–protein interaction studies, ensuring that bioactive lipids are afforded the same level of proteomic scrutiny as their protein counterparts."

By leveraging standardized data formatting and interactive visualization—including study-specific analysis pages, lipid probe aggregation, and cross-study comparisons via a Shiny application—the platform facilitates intuitive exploration of protein–lipid interactions. As a living repository, we actively encourage researchers to contribute their findings through our Data Submission page, ensuring that this resource continues to evolve alongside advancements in lipidomics research.\n\n\nFAIR data principles\nThe Lipid Interactome database was developed with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in mind, ensuring that lipid–protein interaction data can be systematically explored, compared, and reused by the research community. Given the historical inconsistency in proteomics data curation, we have taken deliberate steps to standardize, annotate, and document our datasets for maximum utility.\n\nFindable\nTo address the fragmented nature of lipid interactome studies, we have established a centralized platform where researchers can interact with the results of individual studies or explore aggregated findings across multiple studies on a given lipid. The repository is structured to facilitate intuitive navigation between experimental datasets, offering clear entry points for study-specific and lipid-specific analyses. Because this resource is intended as a living repository, we actively invite researchers to contribute their findings following the submission guidelines detailed on our Data Submission page.\n\n\nAccessible\nAll datasets within the Lipid Interactome are available for download in standardized .csv format, ensuring broad accessibility across different computational environments. To further enhance usability, we provide a detailed overview of data generation and analysis, including explicit descriptions of dataset structure, column definitions, and the inherent limitations of multifunctional lipid probes. Only peer-reviewed proteomics datasets are included in this repository to maintain high data quality and reliability.\n\n\nInteroperable\nGiven the diversity of methodologies employed across lipid interactome studies, we have taken care to harmonize data formats and metadata annotations. While many studies share common analytical pipelines, others employ distinct mass spectrometry workflows. To ensure consistency, we have structured the data to allow parallel comparisons and provided documentation on methodological differences. This standardization effort facilitates direct cross-study comparisons without requiring extensive reformatting by the end user.\n\n\nReusable\nTo maximize the utility of these datasets, we provide extensive documentation detailing data acquisition, analysis workflows, and potential limitations. Wherever possible, technical jargon has been minimized to ensure accessibility to a broad audience, from lipid biologists to computational scientists. Additionally, we reference key publications that delve deeper into the synthesis of lipid probes and the specifics of each proteomics workflow, allowing researchers to further contextualize and validate their findings.\nBy adhering to these FAIR principles, the Lipid Interactome database aims to serve as a robust and enduring resource for the lipid biology community, reducing redundancy, improving data transparency, and accelerating the study of lipid-mediated signaling.\n\n\n\nData Visualization and Download Modules\nTo facilitate efficient exploration and analysis of lipid–protein interaction data, the Lipid Interactome repository incorporates a suite of interactive visualization and data access tools. These modules are designed to enhance user engagement, provide clear interpretability of experimental findings, and streamline data retrieval for further computational analysis.\n\nStudy-Specific Data Exploration\nEach study contributing to the repository is provided with a dedicated results page, allowing users to examine its findings in detail. These pages include interactive Volcano, Ranked-Order, and MA plots, which enable visualization of differential protein enrichment across experimental conditions. The plots are rendered using the Plotly and htmlwidgetsR packages, ensuring a responsive, client-side experience that supports zooming, hovering, and data filtering [REF: Plotly, htmlwidgets]. For transparency and reproducibility, all datasets associated with a given study are available for direct download.\n\n\nLipid Probe-Specific Pages\nBeyond individual study pages, datasets are further organized by lipid probe, providing a consolidated view of protein interactors detected across multiple experiments. Each lipid-specific page includes study metadata, cell type, and facilitates cross-study comparisons. Future iterations of the repository will extend this functionality by enabling direct comparisons of interactomes obtained from different cell lines treated with the same lipid probe, further refining the contextual understanding of lipid–protein interactions.\n\n\nComparative Analysis via Shiny Application\nWhere study design permits, data has been integrated into an interactive Shiny application, allowing users to perform direct probe-to-probe comparisons (Probe vs Probe Comparisons). This tool enables researchers to explore the similarity of lipid interactomes across experimental conditions via linear regression analysis, highlighting proteins that are significantly enriched in one dataset, both datasets, or neither. By providing an intuitive framework for interactome comparison, this feature aids in the identification of promising targets for further investigation.\nThese data access and visualization tools are designed to ensure that the Lipid Interactome is not merely a static repository, but rather a dynamic and evolving resource for lipid biologists and bioinformaticians alike.\n\n\n\nData format\nWhile there are numerous ways to quantify the mass spectrometry (MS) data, the studies included in our repository have utilized the same (or highly similar) quantitative MS pipeline using Tandem Mass Tagging[REF]. These datasets include those reported by Farley et al. (2024), Farley et al. (2024), and Thomas et al. (2025)3,5,6. Correspondingly, the ideal data structure for incorporation into our repository will include the following:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Example data table for smooth incorporation into Lipid Interactome. Column descriptions: Gene name: The identifier for genes identified in the dataset (or Accession Number).

However, as the number of published lipid interactome studies grows, the lack of a centralized framework for comparing and integrating these datasets presents a significant challenge. The Lipid Interactome was developed to address this need by providing researchers with a structured platform to explore, cross-reference, and build upon previous findings. By aggregating and standardizing lipid–protein interaction data, this resource facilitates the rapid identification of candidate lipid-binding proteins and supports orthogonal validation efforts.\nDesigned as a continuously expanding repository, the Lipid Interactome will evolve alongside advances in lipid probe technologies and interactomics. Future iterations will incorporate validation studies for each lipid probe, offering researchers a dedicated space to compare findings across experimental contexts. This functionality will not only reduce redundancy in experimental design but also strengthen the reproducibility and biological interpretation of lipid interactome research. To support this vision, we invite researchers to contribute their datasets via our Data Submission page, fostering a collaborative and transparent approach to lipid biology."

    "section": "Introduction: Why Study Lipid Interactomes?",
    "text": "Introduction: Why Study Lipid Interactomes?\nAt its core, biology is a complex network of chemical interactions. Every biological process—from metabolism to signaling—depends on the physical interactions between molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. While proteins have long been the primary focus of interaction studies, lipids play an equally crucial yet often under-appreciated role in cellular function. Therefore, there is a need for detailed knowledge of lipid-protein interactions (the lipid interactome), in healthy and diseased cells and tissue.\n\nLipid-Lipid Interactions and Membrane Properties\nLipids are primarily organized within membrane bilayers, where their interactions define critical membrane properties such as rigidity, fluidity, and resistance to detergents. By studying lipid-lipid interactions and lipid interactomes, researchers will gain deeper insight into how these molecular interactions influence local and global membrane architecture and dynamics. Understanding these interactions and interactomes is essential for unraveling fundamental processes like vesicle trafficking, cell signaling, and membrane compartmentalization.\n\n\nLipids as Signaling Molecules\nBeyond their structural roles, many lipids have been increasingly recognized as key signaling molecules. For example, the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a pivotal role in immune function. S1P binds to a specific family of receptors, triggering T cell migration (extravasation) and guiding their movement toward sites of infection. Rapidly turned-over phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate triggers cell survival, growth, movement, and proliferation. These examples highlights how lipid signaling can affect cellular behavior and physiological responses.\n\n\nLipid-Protein Interactions: Unlocking Cellular Communication\nA single lipid species can interact with a diverse array of proteins, influencing everything from receptor activation to intracellular signaling cascades. Mapping these lipid-protein interactions provides a powerful approach to understanding how lipids exert their wide-ranging effects on cellular processes. By deciphering lipid interactomes, researchers can uncover novel regulatory mechanisms and potentially identify new therapeutic targets in diseases where lipid signaling is dysregulated."

    "text": "Synthetic Lipid Analogs: Powerful Tools for Lipid Biology\nThe study of lipid biology has been greatly advanced by synthetic lipid analogs. However, it may not be immediately clear why such analogs are essential research tools. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, lipids present unique challenges that make traditional genetic tools less effective in studying their function. In addition, synthetic lipid tools are designed to provide a defined composition of fatty acids and carbon backbones connected to a specific head group while genetic and pharmacological methods are more likely to produce a diverse group of lipid species.\n\nWhy Lipids Require a Different Approach\nAdvances in genetic engineering—such as CRISPR and de novo gene synthesis—have revolutionized the study of nucleic acids and proteins. These techniques enable precise modifications, such as altering enzyme activity, redirecting proteins to different subcellular locations, modifying binding domains, and tagging proteins for visualization or isolation.\nIn contrast, lipids present unique challenges that make genetic approaches impractical. Unlike proteins, which are directly encoded in DNA, lipids are synthesized enzymatically. Their structures cannot be modified in living cells through genetic manipulation alone. Traditional approaches, such as gene knockouts or knock-ins, can broadly alter lipid composition but do not allow for precise control over individual lipid species.\nLipids are also much smaller than proteins, often composed of just a few dozen atoms. Even minor modifications can significantly alter their biophysical properties and biological function. Unlike proteins, which can tolerate the addition of large fluorescent or affinity tags, lipids tolerate only minimal chemical modifications to preserve their activity.\nAdditionally, lipids exist within a highly dynamic metabolic network, where they are continuously synthesized, modified, and degraded. Some signaling lipids, such as sphingosine, ceramide, and phosphatidic acid, have extremely short half-lives – sometimes less than a minute -— making them difficult to track in real-time.\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have developed synthetic lipid analogs with chemical modifications that allow for targeted investigation while preserving essential biological properties. The following sections detail key modifications used in functional lipid probes.\n\n\nThe Role of Synthetic Lipid Analogs\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have developed synthetic analogs of native lipids. These modified lipids allow for precise investigation of lipid function while preserving their essential biological properties. The key modifications used in this approach include a photo-crosslinking group (usually a diazirine), an alkyne group for click chemistry, and a photo-removable (cage) group for preventing premature probe metabolism.\n\nDiazirine group\nLipid-protein interactions are inherently transient and dynamic, making them particularly challenging to capture and study. Unlike protein-protein interactions, which often rely on extensive surface interfaces and hydrogen bonding, most lipids have minimal hydrogen bonding potential and lack a substantial structural framework for stable interactions. As a result, even biologically relevant lipid-protein contacts may be too fleeting to detect under standard biochemical conditions.\nTo effectively identify and analyze lipid-binding proteins, it is necessary to stabilize these interactions in a way that allows their subsequent enrichment and detection. While affinity enrichment approaches (e.g., lipid pulldown assays) can be used, they often require detergents to solubilize membrane-associated complexes, which can introduce artifacts or disrupt weak lipid-protein interactions. Covalent crosslinking, on the other hand, offers a far more reliable method to “freeze” these interactions in place, preserving their native binding state even during rigorous purification steps before mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nWhy Use Diazirine as a Crosslinking Motif?\nSeveral chemical groups can be used for covalent crosslinking, but diazirine rings are particularly well-suited for lipid studies due to their small size and minimal structural interference. Other crosslinking devices are mostly aromatic and hence may alter the lipid’s physicochemical properties, potentially changing its location and interaction profile. Non-aromatic diazirine, however, is the smallest known photoactivatable crosslinking group, making it an ideal choice for studying delicate lipid-protein interactions.\n\n\nKey properties of diazirine crosslinking:\nLipid interactions are typically transient, as most lipid backbones lack opportunities for strong hydrogen bonding and are too small to provide a significant binding interface. Identifying interacting proteins requires stabilizing these interactions to allow for enrichment and analysis. While affinity-based approaches can help, covalent crosslinking is the most effective method, as it enables the removal of impurities and detergents before mass spectrometry analysis.\nAmong the various crosslinking motifs, the diazirine ring is the smallest, making it the least likely to interfere with a lipid’s natural interactions. Upon exposure to 355 nm UV light, the diazirine ring forms a reactive carbene radical, which rapidly covalently bonds with nearby molecules. This reaction is highly versatile, as the carbene can insert into carbon-hydrogen, sulfur-hydrogen, nitrogen-hydrogen, oxygen-hydrogen, or double bonds, allowing for broad coverage of potential interaction partners1.Despite these numerous options, reaction with glutamate seems to be modestly preferred2.\nThe small size and high reactivity of diazirine crosslinking make it an invaluable tool for capturing lipid-protein interactions while minimizing perturbations to native lipid function.\n\n\nThe effect of diazirine placement on crosslinking targets\nThe reactive carbene produced upon irradiation will bond with whatever molecule is nearest – thus, the location of the diazirine ring can have a dramatic effect on what protein interactors are stabilized via crosslinking.\nThe majority of lipid analogs produced to date were synthesized with the diazirine ring near the terminal end of an acyl chain. For example, 8-3 Fatty Acid has diazirine on carbon 10 of the fatty acid. These lipid analogs may be expected to preferentially crosslink to proteins which penetrate far into the hydrophobic region between the leaflets of a membrane bilayer, such as transmembrane proteins.\nIn comparison, moving the diazirine ring closer to the hydrophilic headgroup may increase the partiality of crosslinking towards peripheral membrane proteins in addition to transmembrane proteins. An example of this shift is 1-10 Fatty Acid, in which the diazirine ring was diazirine on carbon 3 of the fatty acid.\n\n\n\nTerminal Alkyne\nWhen studying proteins, researchers often use genetic methods to tag or modify them, making them easier to visualize or isolate. For example, adding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain to a protein allows it to be seen under a fluorescence microscope, whereas incorporating an HA tag enables enrichment using antibody pulldown techniques. These approaches work well for proteins because they are encoded by genes and can be modified at the DNA level.\nLipids, however, cannot be modified in the same way. Their synthesis occurs enzymatically, meaning there is no genetic sequence to alter. Large additions, like a GFP or HA domain, would drastically change a lipid’s properties, making it unrecognizable to the proteins and pathways that typically interact with it. Instead, a much smaller modification is needed—one that allows researchers to track and manipulate lipids without interfering with their biological function.\n\nA versatile bioorthogonal handle\nOne of the smallest and most effective modifications for this purpose is the terminal alkyne. This functional group consists of a simple triple bond at the end of a carbon chain, a minor structural change that does not significantly alter the lipid’s behavior. Despite its small size, the terminal alkyne serves as a powerful chemical handle, allowing researchers to attach various probes after the lipid has been introduced into a biological system.\nThe terminal alkyne is particularly useful because it undergoes azide-alkyne cycloaddition, the prototypical click chemistry reaction. This reaction is highly specific, rapid, and bio-orthogonal, meaning it does not interfere with natural cellular processes. By reacting the alkyne with an azide-containing probe, researchers can introduce fluorescent markers for imaging or affinity tags for isolating lipid-protein complexes. The reaction requires catalysis by copper (I) ions and is therefore usually not suitable for intact cells and tissues but works well in fixed or lysed samples.\n\n\nApplications in Lipid Research\nBy providing a simple yet effective means of modifying lipids without disrupting their native properties, the terminal alkyne has become an essential tool in lipidomics and chemical biology. One major application of the terminal alkyne is fluorescence labeling. A functionalized lipid can be introduced into cells and later reacted with a fluorophore-conjugated, ideally fluorogenic, azide, allowing researchers to visualize the lipid’s location in fixed cells. By using pulse-chase experiments, lipid movement is also trackable.\nAnother important use is affinity-based enrichment. Lipids containing a terminal alkyne can be captured using azide-functionalized beads, enabling the isolation of lipid-protein complexes after photo-crosslinking for analysis by mass spectrometry. This method has been instrumental in identifying proteins that interact with specific lipid species, shedding light on lipid signaling pathways and metabolic networks.\n\n\n\nCoumarin Photocage\nLipids play an essential role in cellular signaling which often relies on transient abundance of lipid species. Hence, studying lipids in intact cells presents unique challenges due to their highly dynamic metabolism. Unlike proteins, which are relatively stable once synthesized, many bioactive lipids are continuously synthesized, modified, interconverted, and degraded as part of an extensive and tightly regulated lipid metabolic network. Even lipids so far not associated with cellular signaling show rapid turnover, which makes it difficult to study the effects of a specific lipid species in isolation, as the lipid of interest may be enzymatically altered before it can exert its intended biological function.\nOne strategy to overcome this challenge is using photocaged lipid analogs, which remain biologically inert until exposed to a specific wavelength of light. Irradiation with this wavelength “uncages” the lipid derivative within seconds to reveal its native structure. This allows researchers to control the timing and location of lipid activation, enabling targeted investigation of lipid function with high spatiotemporal resolution.\n\nA light-activated protection group\nOne of the most effective tools for photocaging lipids is based on 7-diethylamino-4-methylene coumarin, a photolabile protection group that can be removed upon exposure to 400 nm light. When attached to a lipid’s headgroup, the coumarin moiety temporarily blocks interactions with proteins, preventing the lipid from participating in its normal biological pathways. However, upon photoactivation, the coumarin group is cleaved, restoring the lipid to its native structure and allowing it to engage with its biological targets.\nThis approach is useful for studying lipid-protein interactions, as uncaging the lipid in a controlled manner ensures that protein binders recognize the native lipid structure only when and where the researcher intends.\nAn alternative to coumarin-based caging groups are o-nitrobenzyl.\n\n\nApplications in Cellular Signaling Studies\nThe power of coumarin-caged lipids has been demonstrated in studies examining intracellular lipid signaling. For example, in 2015, Höglinger et al. used a caged sphingosine analog to investigate the role of sphingosine in calcium signaling. They found that upon photoactivation of the caged sphingosine, lysosomal calcium release was triggered, revealing a crucial link between sphingosine metabolism and intracellular calcium dynamics3. This discovery significantly expanded the understanding of the sphingosine signaling cascade and its downstream effects.\nBeyond biochemical studies, coumarin-caged lipids enable live-cell imaging approaches. Selectively irradiating specific subcellular regions allows the researcher to uncage lipids in a highly localized manner and assess their effects in real time. While this approach is not well-suited for large-scale proteomic studies, it provides a powerful method for investigating lipid function via fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nAn Additional Benefit: Coumarin’s Inherent Fluorescence\nA unique advantage of using coumarin as a photocaging group is its intrinsic fluorescence. This means that before the lipid is even uncaged, its cellular incorporation can be directly visualized using a fluorescence microscope. By tracking fluorescence intensity and distribution, researchers can quickly determine whether a functionalized lipid has successfully intercalated into the target cell’s membrane or accumulated in specific subcellular compartments.\nThis dual functionality—serving as both a caging group and a fluorescent probe—makes coumarin a useful tool for studying lipid localization, uptake, and bioactivity.\nThese modifications stabilize protein-lipid interactions and enable the selective enrichment of lipid-bound proteins, all while maintaining tight spatial and temporal control. Each of these tools is described in further detail below."

    "text": "Limitations of multifunctionalized lipid probes\n\nWhile significant effort has minimized the effect that each modification has on the biophysical properties of the lipid analogs, it remains the case that adding a diazirine and a terminal alkyne will necessarily affect their physical properties – perhaps affecting sub-cellular localization and binding.\nThe coumarin cage has been repeatedly shown to protect lipid analogs from premature metabolism, but it should be recognized that this comes with some distinct changes to the behavior of the native lipid.\n\nFor example, when a cell is treated with a photocaged lipid probe, the probe intercalates into every membrane in the cell – including membranes which the native lipid would not enter. This may lead to the identification of non-biologically-relevant hits.\n\nSimilarly, the diazirine and alkyne groups may have minor effects on the biophysical properties of the lipid probe as it interacts with other lipids and proteins within the membrane bilayer. This may be more relevant for proteins which preferentially bind to the acyl chain.\n\nFor example, Some work has been done to demonstrate that the placement of the diazirine ring along the length of the acyl chain can have impacts on the interactome of the lipid probe4. Farley et al (2024) demonstrated this using trifunctional Fatty Acid probes by placing the diazirine either 3 carbons from the terminus (8-3 FA) or 10 carbons from the terminus (1-10 FA). They identified several proteins with distinct enrichment profiles, including VDAC1 and VDAC2 (which are preferentially enriched to the 8-3 FA probe), and ACAD9 and UBB (which are preferentially enriched to the 1-10 FA probe).\n\nQuantification of +UV versus -UV\n\nThe details of the quantitative mass spectrometry are describe in our Overview of Proteomics Methods, however, we hope to succinctly describe that quantitative mass spectrometry techniques necessarily require normalization at sample input level – thereby exaggerating the abundance of proteins in the -UV control samples.\nIt should be noted, therefore, that there is little meaning to a protein which is “enriched” toward the -UV condition. For this reason, all proteins which are “depleted” following irradiation with UV have been designated as “no hit” in our analyses."

    "section": "Interactomics Experimental schema",
    "text": "Interactomics Experimental schema\nIn this overview, we aim to explain the fundamental procedures of utilizing lipid probes in proteomics analysis. Figure 1 depicts the steps described below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCell treatment\nAs has been reported previously by Höglinger et al. (2017), Muller et al. (2021), Farley et al. (2024), Farley et al. (2024), and Thomas et al. (2025), lipid probes are readily taken up by cell membranes within minutes upon treatment with lipid probes at concentrations ranging from 2 (as for trifunctional sphingosine and sphinganine) to 5 (as for trifunctional phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine) to 100 (as for trifunctional diacylglycerol)1–5. These studies utilized the inherent fluorescence of the coumarin cage to validate the uptake and wide intercalation of the lipid probes throughout the cell6.\n\n\nUncaging\nIrradiation with 405 nm wavelength light induces the release of the coumarin photocage and thus allows for the recognition and metabolism of the headgroup of the lipid probe (See our Coumarin overview for more background on using the coumarin photocage).\nSubstantial work has validated that these lipid probes are recognized by the cell as their native counterparts, as the remaining functional groups have minimal effect on the probes’ biophysical properties. This has been validated in numerous studies, including Höglinger et al. (2015) and Höglinger et al. (2017), Muller et al. (2020) and Muller et al. (2020), and Farley et al. (2024) and Farley et al. (2024)1,2,7,8.\n\n\nCrosslinking\nIrradiation with 355 nm wavelength light induces the production of a reactive carbene which readily inserts itself into any nearby biochemical bond (See our Diazirine overview for more background on diazirine crosslinking). Notably, the majority of probes will likely crosslink with either water or with neighboring lipids. Quantitative proteomics analysis will fully ignore these conjugates, as only enriched peptides will be measured in the final mass spectrometry analysis (described below in our Mass spectrometry overview).\nThe covalently bound lipid protein conjugates which form after crosslinking are highly stable and thus are ideally amenable toward stringent enrichment and washing, producing a high-quality sample with few non-specific proteins tagging along.\n\n\nCell lysis and sample collection\nDepending on application, may want to perform a membrane prep or otherwise isolate an organelle of interest (e.g. mitochondrial enrichment, if one is seeking mitochondrial interactions)\nDue to the high stability of the diazirine crosslinking bond, no extra steps need to be taken to ensure that interactions are maintained – lysis can be as aggressive as one wishes.\nIn general, samples due for mass spectrometry analysis should be kept with as little detergent as possible to protect the instrument – however, because the crosslinking bond is covalent and the downstream affinity purification is covalent, these samples may be washed very stringently and thus remove effectively all contaminating detergents. Thus, a mild detergent such as NP-40 can be included in the lysis buffer of these samples.\n\n\nAffinity purification of probe-conjugated proteins\n(See our Alkyne overview for more background on alkyne click chemistry)\n\nExample using azide beads: Perform click chemistry reaction in presence of beads coated with picolyl-azide functional groups for covalent capture\nConjugates of protein-lipid-bead are covalently bound and can thus be stringently washed with detergent solutions to remove non-specific proteins. Detergent can then be removed with repeated high volume washes of 8 M urea and 20 % acetonitrile.\nCaptured proteins are then reduced and alkylated on-bead.\nPeptides are digested off the protein-lipid-bead conjugates via tryptic digest. Digested peptides are then desalted to remove any remaining contaminants using reverse phase desalting columns.\n\n\n\nMass spectrometry analysis\nBroadly, all mass spectrometry techniques for proteomic identification of differentially-enriched proteins will involve injection into a mass spectrometer via liquid chromatography. Within the mass spectrometer, individual peptides can be isolated and fragmented to determine their sequence.\nThere are several methodologies commonly used to quantify mass spectrometry data. At the highest level, these may be separated into label-free and label-based quantification techniques. Both categories are valid for reporting differential enrichment, and each has pros and cons – discussed in detail below.\n\nLabel-Free Quantification\nLabel-free quantification (LFQ) is a widely used mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach that estimates protein abundance without chemical labeling. Instead, it relies on comparing the summed intensity of detected peptides across different samples analyzed under identical conditions.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPeptide Detection (MS1): Peptides are isolated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nPeptide Sequencing (MS2): Selected peptide ions are fragmented, and the resulting spectra determine peptide sequences.\nQuantification: The total signal intensity of all identified peptides corresponding to a protein is summed as a proxy for its abundance.\nComparison Across Samples: Samples prepared and analyzed using the same LC-MS/MS protocol can be compared using peptide-spectrum match (PSM) counts as an abundance proxy.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Label-Free Quantification\n\nCost-Effective & Simple Sample Preparation: Unlike labeling methods (e.g., TMT), LFQ does not require expensive reagents or complex modifications, making it more accessible.\nFlexible & Widely Used: Compatible with various experimental designs and allows for comparisons across many samples without multiplexing constraints.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nPotential Bias from Co-Elution: High-abundance peptides can overshadow low-abundance ones, reducing the number of reliably quantified peptides.\nRun-to-Run Variability: LFQ requires separate MS runs for each sample, making it susceptible to differences in instrument calibration, chromatography conditions, or sample handling. Careful quality control is necessary to minimize artificial differences.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nLabel-free quantification is a practical and widely used method for proteomics research. While cost-effective and flexible, its accuracy depends on careful experimental design and quality control to reduce variability.\n\n\n\nIsotopic Label-based quantification\nAll label-based mass spectrometry quantification methods use stable isotopes to distinguish the source of proteins within a pooled collective of several experimental samples. Previously, the technique known as Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) was common, though this has fallen out of use due to significant cost and difficult sample preparation.\nModern isotopic label-based techniques such as iTRAQ (isotopic Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantification) and TMT (Tandem Mass Tagging) have become the norm. Isotopic labeling is a powerful quantitative mass spectrometry technique that enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in a single MS run. This approach improves efficiency and allows for precise relative quantification of proteins across experimental conditions. For the purposes of this overview, we will focus on TMT as it has greater capacity for samples per experiment (16+ as opposed to 8), and the techniques are fundamentally similar.\n\nHow It Works\n\nChemical Labeling: Each sample is chemically tagged with a unique TMT label, which consists of a reactive group binding to peptides and a mass reporter for sample differentiation.\nSample Pooling: Labeled samples are combined into a single pooled group, reducing the need for separate MS runs.\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\n\nMS1 (Peptide Isolation): Peptides are separated and detected based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).\nMS2 (Peptide Sequencing & Tag Fragmentation): Peptides are fragmented for sequence identification, and TMT mass tags fragment to generate reporter ions.\n\nQuantification: The intensity of reporter ions reveals the relative abundance of peptides across the original samples.\nComparison Across Samples: Within a TMT cassette (typically 16 samples), relative protein abundance is calculated from the reporter ion intensities. A pooled control channel enables comparison across cassettes, allowing many samples to be analyzed in a single experiment or large-scale study.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of TMT Labeling\n\nIncreased Throughput & Efficiency: Enables multiplexing of many samples (e.g., 16 or more), reducing the number of separate MS runs.\nDeeper Proteome Coverage: Pooled samples can be fractionated (e.g., by cation exchange chromatography), enhancing detection of low-abundance peptides.\nImproved Quantification Accuracy: Since all samples are analyzed in the same MS run, technical variability between runs is minimized.\n\n\n\nChallenges & Considerations\n\nHigher Cost: TMT reagents and high-end mass spectrometers add to the expense.\nComplex Sample Preparation: Requires additional steps for labeling, pooling, and fractionation, increasing the risk of sample handling variability.\nNormalization Requirement: Accurate quantification requires equal protein input across samples to avoid artificial balancing biases.\nDemanding Instrumentation & Expertise: Requires high-resolution mass spectrometers, often necessitating specialized facilities.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nTMT-based mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for large-scale proteomics, offering high-throughput, precise, and deep proteome coverage. While it requires advanced instrumentation and careful sample preparation, its ability to multiplex multiple samples in a single run makes it an attractive option for high-confidence protein quantification.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:"

We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo-crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.\n\n\n\nPI(3,4,5)P3\n\n\n\nHeLa\n\n\n\nPeptide spectral counting",

Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain their utility have not been thoroughly described. Here, we synthesize three palmitic acid derivatives with a diazirine at different positions on the acyl chain and examine their metabolism, subcellular localization, and protein interactions. We demonstrate that while they produce very similar metabolites and subcellular distributions, probes with the diazirine at either end pulldown distinct subsets of proteins after photo-crosslinking.

Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) de-signed to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. Due to its aromatic caging group, 1 is initially concentrating in perinuclear membranes. After uncaging, rapid translocation to mitochondria was observed. Hence, the tool is useful for tracking PE location and for determining the PE interactome.

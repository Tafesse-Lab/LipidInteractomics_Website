<p>Functions of the sphingolipids sphingosine and sphinganine in cells are not well established. While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.</p>

<p>Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student’s t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV).</p>

<p>Ranked-order plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (y-axis) from lowest to highest. The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV).</p>

<p>MA plots depict the average abundance of each protein in the crosslinked and uncrosslinked conditions (x-axis) versus the log2-transformed fold-change between the crosslinked and uncrosslinked conditions (y-axis). Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV).</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: GO Dot plots display the enrichment of GO terms among the proteins enriched to the probe. For these analyses, only proteins categorized as “enriched candidates” and “enriched hits” were subject to GO analysis. The Cell Compartment analysis assesses whether the list of enriched proteins contains a statistically significant number of proteins in the same cellular region; appropriately, the Molecular Function and Biological Process analyses does the same for molecular function and biological process, respectively. <a href="../Background/DataAnalysisAndStatistics.html#gene-ontology-overview">Click here for more information about Gene Ontology analysis.</a>

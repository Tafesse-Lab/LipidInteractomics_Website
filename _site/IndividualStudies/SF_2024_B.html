<p>Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain their utility have not been thoroughly described. Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain their utility have not been thoroughly described. Here, we synthesize three palmitic acid derivatives with a diazirine at different positions on the acyl chain and examine their metabolism, subcellular localization, and protein interactions. We demonstrate that while they produce very similar metabolites and subcellular distributions, probes with the diazirine at either end pulldown distinct subsets of proteins after photo-crosslinking. This highlights the importance of thoughtful diazirine placement when developing probes based on biological molecules.</p>

<p>Ranked-order plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus control (y-axis) from lowest to highest. The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple proteins are enriched to the probe but fall below a FDR or p-value threshold of significance, and Orange proteins surpass the threshold of significance (need details of threshold).</p>

<p>Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student’s t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple proteins are enriched to the probe but fall below a FDR or p-value threshold of significance, and Orange proteins surpass the threshold of significance (need details of threshold).</p>

<p>Functions of the sphingolipids sphingosine and sphinganine in cells are not well established. While some signaling roles for sphingosine have been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. The underlying mechanisms behind the cell biological differences between these lipids are not well understood. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized derivatives of the two lipid species that only differ in a single double bond of the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define their spatiotemporal distribution within cells. Furthermore, we used these tools to systematically map the protein interactomes of both lipids. The lipid-protein conjugates, prepared through photo-crosslinking in live cells and extraction via click chemistry to azide beads, revealed significant differences in the captured proteins, highlighting their distinct roles in various cellular processes. This work elucidates mechanistic differences between these critical lipids and sets the foundation for further studies on the functions of sphingosine and sphinganine.</p>

<p>Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student’s t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple proteins are enriched to the probe but fall below a FDR or p-value threshold of significance, and Orange proteins surpass the threshold of significance (need details of threshold).</p>

<p>Ranked-order plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus control (y-axis) from lowest to highest. The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple proteins are enriched to the probe but fall below a FDR or p-value threshold of significance, and Orange proteins surpass the threshold of significance (need details of threshold).</p>

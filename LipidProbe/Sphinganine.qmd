GO Dot plots display the enrichment of GO terms among the proteins enriched to the probe. For these analyses, only proteins categorized as "enriched candidates" and "enriched hits" were subject to GO analysis. The Cell Compartment analysis assesses whether the list of enriched proteins contains a statistically significant number of proteins in the same cellular region; appropriately, the Molecular Function and Biological Process analyses does the same for molecular function and biological process, respectively.

## Data exploration and download

Check the boxes below to filter by significance thresholds.

:::{.border}
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Here is the code to make the filterable lists shown in the crosstalk table below

data <- data |>
  dplyr::select(gene_name, hit_annotation, logFC, pvalue, fdr) |>
  mutate(logFC = signif(logFC, digits=3),
          pvalue = signif(pvalue, digits=3),
          fdr = signif(fdr, digits = 3)) |>
  arrange(hit_annotation) 

## Creates a reactive dataframe
data_reactive <- crosstalk::SharedData$new(data)

htmltools::tags$div(
  class = "filter-container",
  filter_checkbox(id = "hit_annotation",
                  label = "Enrichment criteria:",

                  group = ~hit_annotation,
                  inline="true")
)

## Displays the reactive dataframe

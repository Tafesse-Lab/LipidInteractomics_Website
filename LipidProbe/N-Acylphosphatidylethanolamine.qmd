##### Volcano Plot

```{r NAPE_volcano, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis, log2 transformed and median normalized) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student's t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). Black proteins are identified in only one replicate, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins identified in two replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins identified in all three replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01)."

```

##### Ranked Order Plot

```{r NAPE_RO, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Ranked-order plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (y-axis) from lowest to highest. Black proteins are identified in only one replicate, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins identified in two replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins identified in all three replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01)."

##### MA Plot

```{r, NAPE_MA, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "MA plots depict the average abundance of each protein in the crosslinked and uncrosslinked conditions (x-axis) versus the log2-transformed fold-change between the crosslinked and uncrosslinked conditions (y-axis). Black proteins are identified in only one replicate, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins identified in two replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins identified in all three replicates & fold-change > 1.5 (logFC 0.585) & pvalue < 0.01)."

## Gene Ontology Analysis

**In beta: GO analysis still under development**

:::::{.border}

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Cell Compartment

<iframe src="/LipidProbe/GO_plots/1-10FA_SF_2024_CC-DOTplot.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

#### Molecular Function

(No MF pathways identified among enriched hits and candidates.)

#### Biological Process

(No BP pathways identified among enriched hits and candidates.)

:::

GO Dot plots display the enrichment of GO terms among the proteins enriched to the probe. For these analyses, only proteins categorized as "enriched candidates" and "enriched hits" were subject to GO analysis. The Cell Compartment analysis assesses whether the list of enriched proteins contains a statistically significant number of proteins in the same cellular region; appropriately, the Molecular Function and Biological Process analyses does the same for molecular function and biological process, respectively.

## Data exploration and download

```{r datatable, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Here is the code to make the filterable lists shown in the crosstalk table below

data <- data |>

          pvalue = signif(pvalue, digits=3),
          fdr = signif(fdr, digits = 3)) |>
  arrange(hit_annotation, -logFC)

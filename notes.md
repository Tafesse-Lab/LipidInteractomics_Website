## 2025/31/01

To-do today
- combine glycerophospholipid into one category
- Determine metadata to incorporate into data download files
- Build site documentation page
	- Site/file structure
	- Github repository
	- 

## 2025/29/01

- Combine glycerophospholipids into one category
- Message Andre Nadler to give them basic format for how to receive the data 
- Add points on axes for proteins identified in only one or the other datasets
- Email service

- Write brief communications paper
	- Database Journal
	- Nuclear acid sub-base journal
	- Bioinformatics Journal Application note

## 2025/21/01

### To discuss
- What to do with datasets with no logFC-type data
	- Ana's PI paper has heat maps that I can replicate, but no enrichment data
	- Doris's early tf-Sph/tf-DAG paper also has heat maps that I've tried to replicate, but it looks terrible with all the proteins displayed (filter hits to significant?)
	
### Feedback?
- FT mentioned structure images are too large - can make them smaller?
- Consistency of structure cartoons?
	- need standard format
- Features we should add?

### Email plan

- current email service is through Zoho, and I can add free accounts for up to users. The problem is that there is zero forwarding, so the users will need to check the Zoho site regularly to make sure there aren't comments/submissions.

### CS to-do
- Find experiment p numbers for Frank to reanalyze or share data.
	- Asking Andre Nadler for dataset numbers
- Find further studies to incorporate

### FT to-do
- Logo

### GG to-do
- Decide on format for non-TMT data (heat maps? Venn diagrams?)
- Data submission form
- Incorporate new data once sent from Frank
- Link to PRIDE database for non-curated datasets in each study
- Hover preview of chemical structure when referenced
- Sign up for paid zoho accounts for Fikadu and Carsten
- Add detailed structure cartoons with hover interactivity - especially for 8-3/1-10 FA.

## 2025/14/01

### Feedback

- What do we want from this database?
	- reference: people can compare interactomes in different cell lines

- Subcellular localization is maybe too complicated to have on this site
	- How to communicate nuance?
		- Caged vs uncaged
	- Describe time-course?

#### Things we like

- Interactivity
- Cleanliness of theme

#### Things we don't like

- Remove subcellular localization
- Make font size for heirarchy of sidebar menu more clear

#### Things to add

- Add inset tabs of each cell type analyzed to each probe page
- Bifunctional sphingosine papers from Per
- Write article about how probes are used

#### Formatting options

- theme
- organization
- references
- Structure depiction
	- Static image
	- Embedded model (will need more work)

### CS to-do

* Share list of relevant studies
	- Message Frank Stein for data
* Share structures of probes
* In what journal would a commentary about this site fit best?

### FT to-do

* Think about site logo
	* Do you want Tephra to design?
	* LipidMaps logo might be good inspiration, but we want better
	* Carsten wants simple, modern

### GG to-do

* Add new data, as provided by CS
	- 
* Add structures of each probe, as provided by CS
* Add Contact Us submission form
* Commentary about site
	- Title: Lipid Interactome Repository
	- Look for journal
		- Journal of Lipid Research?
* Build a probe comparison page
	- Ideally we want a select list of proteins which only interact with a given probe (and not with any other probe), regardless of cell line
	- Probe comparison plotter?

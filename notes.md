### Feedback

- What do we want from this database?
	- reference: people can compare interactomes in different cell lines

- Subcellular localization is maybe too complicated to have on this site
	- How to communicate nuance?
		- Caged vs uncaged
	- Describe time-course?

#### Things we like

- Interactivity
- Cleanliness of theme

#### Things we don't like

- Remove subcellular localization
- Make font size for heirarchy of sidebar menu more clear

#### Things to add

- Add inset tabs of each cell type analyzed to each probe page
- Bifunctional sphingosine papers from Per
- Write article about how probes are used

#### Formatting options

- theme
- organization
- references
- Structure depiction
	- Static image
	- Embedded model (will need more work)

### CS to-do

* Share list of relevant studies
	- Message Frank Stein for data
* Share structures of probes
* In what journal would a commentary about this site fit best?

### FT to-do

* Think about site logo
	* Do you want Tephra to design?
	* LipidMaps logo might be good inspiration, but we want better
	* Carsten wants simple, modern

### GG to-do

* Add new data, as provided by CS
	- 
* Add structures of each probe, as provided by CS
* Add Contact Us submission form
* Commentary about site
	- Title: Lipid Interactome Repository
	- Look for journal
		- Journal of Lipid Research?
* Build a probe comparison page
	- Ideally we want a select list of proteins which only interact with a given probe (and not with any other probe), regardless of cell line
	- Probe comparison plotter?

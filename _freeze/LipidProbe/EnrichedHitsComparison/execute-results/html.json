We have prepared the visualization tool below to enable this to be done visually.\n\n<!-- Data wrangling, will comment out most of this when it's all done. \nPulling the enriched hits from each probe, then making a long dataframe that can be plopped into a Venn diagram adjacent visualization -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.border}\n:::{#fig-ProbeVsProbeComparison}\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Shiny App Embedding</title>\n  <style>\n    iframe {\n      width: 100%;\n      height: 75vh;\n      border: none;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <iframe src=\"https://gaelen-guzman.shinyapps.io/lipidinteractomics_shinyapp/\"></iframe>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n\n\nThis Shiny app plots the enrichment results of two user-selected datasets against each other for visual comparison of protein enrichment toward each lipid probe. Use the dropdown menus to select lipid probes to plot against each other and visualize the enriched hits of each probe. Proteins missing in one dataset are temporarily assigned a logFC of 0 for visualization -- thus, they will appear along one axis. Black proteins are unenriched in respect to both probes; Purple proteins are \"enriched\" with respect to only the probe on the x-axis; Green proteins are \"enriched\" with respect to only the probe on the y-axis; and Orange proteins are \"enriched\" in both probes. The significance thresholds for each dataset are as defined on the respective lipid probe or studies page -- this page is intended for a simple qualitative comparison of hits between datasets.\n:::\n\n<!-- \n## Shared hits -->\n\n\n\n\n",

20250509,1,"Made some small changes and rerendered site to make sure everything is up to date.",
20250513,1,"Added Carsten's edits to the first background section of the website. Planned for a more efficient way to manage the publication metadata to make it easier to add new pages.",
20250514,1,"Pushed new probe overview/background section to the deployed site. Started looking at the mass spec overview to see where it needs to be updated.",
20250528,2,"Received data from Zhongwu Guo and began putting into new page of website - data is excellent but converting the accession numbers to gene names is weirdly challenging.",
20250529,1,"Figured out how to get (most of) the gene names! Still have some wrangling and formatting to make the new page complete.",
20250530, 2, "Added the new page to the site & went through my checklist and made sure that all the links work properly. A new weird problem is that my GO search appears broken somehow...",
20250611, 2, "Received comments on bioinformatics manuscript - need to do a ton of work! Started by going through and isolating the wrangling script I used to prepare each dataset for SK_2024 and WY_2021. I may paste these scripts back in to the main page so users can preview the steps taken to wrangle the results into my format.",
20250616, 2, "As on the 11th I spent a while re-working the wrangling script I had for the DCC_2025 data - this will help address the reviewers' concerns that the data wrangling wasn't clear. Also adding back the accession numbers as recommended by a reviewer.",
20250617, 2, "Updated Shiny app (probe vs probe comparison page) with the PDAA data from WY 2021 with Jeremy Baskin's data. Also continued arranging the data wrangling pages to include every step taken.",
20250625, 1, "Only had a little time, got hold of Alix to ask him for his full dataset -- still waiting. Started cleaning up his page but didn't get very far.",
20250626, 2, "Working on cleaning up the first few lipid probe pages to include the accession numbers in the data table and in the downloadable table.",
20250722, 3, "Frank shared his updated analyses of Ana's and Alix's datasets. I started by re-working Alix's data and formatting sections for the 'membrane' and 'cytosolic' fraction results. Waiting to see what Carsten and Fikadu think.",
20250729, 3, "Got the data from Ana's PIP3 publication and the PA/PE data uploaded to their respective pages. Uploaded our manuscript to arXiv preprint server.",
20250828, 4, "Spent a long time going through the reviewer comments about the site -- included many changes to the data pages (adding accession numbers and download links to the data wrangling scripts, fixing captions, adding membrane/cytosol data to the PA/PE pages). This is separate from writing the response letter and adding some edits to the manuscript.",

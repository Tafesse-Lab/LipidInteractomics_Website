20250528,2,"Received data from Zhongwu Guo and began putting into new page of website - data is excellent but converting the accession numbers to gene names is weirdly challenging.",
20250529,1,"Figured out how to get (most of) the gene names! Still have some wrangling and formatting to make the new page complete.",
20250530, 2, "Added the new page to the site & went through my checklist and made sure that all the links work properly. A new weird problem is that my GO search appears broken somehow...",
20250611, 2, "Received comments on bioinformatics manuscript - need to do a ton of work! Started by going through and isolating the wrangling script I used to prepare each dataset for SK_2024 and WY_2021. I may paste these scripts back in to the main page so users can preview the steps taken to wrangle the results into my format."
20250616, 2, "As on the 1th I spent a while re-working the wrangling script I had for the DCC_2025 data - this will help address the reviewers' concerns that the data wrangling wasn't clear. Also adding back the accession numbers as recommended by a reviewer."
20250617, 2, "Updated Shiny app (probe vs probe comparison page) with the PDAA data from WY 2021 with Jeremy Baskin's data. Also continued arranging the data wrangling pages to include every step taken."

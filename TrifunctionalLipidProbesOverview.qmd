I could use help writing a succinct article here to describe the use of these probes. We can additionally reference prior publications here -- but I think it would be nice to have a novel description with figures for this site.

I have a few example figures, but I am open to using whichever figures seem best -- if that is a new figure, I'll need guidance on what it should look like.

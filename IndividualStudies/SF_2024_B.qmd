#### Volcano plots

:::{.border}
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student's t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV)."

GO Dot plots display the enrichment of GO terms among the proteins enriched to the probe. For these analyses, only proteins categorized as "enriched candidates" and "enriched hits" were subject to GO analysis. The Cell Compartment analysis assesses whether the list of enriched proteins contains a statistically significant number of proteins in the same cellular region; appropriately, the Molecular Function and Biological Process analyses does the same for molecular function and biological process, respectively.

## Data exploration and download

Check the boxes below to filter the dataset by which lipid probe was used in the pulldown and by significance thresholds.


:::{.border}
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Here is the code to make the filterable lists shown in the crosstalk table below


data <- data |>
  dplyr::select(gene_name, LipidProbe, hit_annotation, logFC, pvalue, fdr) |>
  mutate(logFC = signif(logFC, digits=3),
          pvalue = signif(pvalue, digits=3),
          fdr = signif(fdr, digits = 3)) |>
  arrange(hit_annotation) |>
  arrange(LipidProbe)

## Creates a reactive dataframe
data_reactive <- crosstalk::SharedData$new(data)

htmltools::tags$div(
  class = "filter-container",
  filter_checkbox(id = "LipidProbe",
                  label = "Lipid probe in pulldown:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~LipidProbe),
  filter_checkbox(id = "hit_annotation",
                  label = "Enrichment criteria:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~hit_annotation)
)

## Displays the reactive dataframe

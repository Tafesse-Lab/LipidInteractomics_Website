```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Volcano plots depict the relative enrichment of each protein versus non-crosslinked control (x-axis) and the statistical significance of each protein following a Student's t-test (y-axis, -log10 transformed). The left panel depicts the results of a pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidic acid; the right panel depicts the results of the pulldown using trifunctionalized phosphatidylethanolamine. Black proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, Purple enriched candidates are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and Orange enriched hits are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV)."

## Data exploration and download

Check the boxes below to filter the dataset by which lipid probe was used in the pulldown and by significance thresholds.

:::{.border}
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Here is the code to make the filterable lists shown in the crosstalk table below

## Creates a reactive dataframe
data_reactive <- crosstalk::SharedData$new(data)


htmltools::tags$div(
  class = "filter-container",
  filter_checkbox(id = "LipidProbe",
                  label = "Lipid probe in pulldown:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~LipidProbe),
  filter_checkbox(id = "hit_annotation",
                  label = "Enrichment criteria:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~hit_annotation)

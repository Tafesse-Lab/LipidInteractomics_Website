GO Dot plots display the enrichment of GO terms among the proteins enriched to the probe. For these analyses, only proteins categorized as "enriched candidates" and "enriched hits" were subject to GO analysis. The Cell Compartment analysis assesses whether the list of enriched proteins contains a statistically significant number of proteins in the same cellular region; appropriately, the Molecular Function and Biological Process analyses does the same for molecular function and biological process, respectively.

### Data exploration

Check the boxes below to filter the dataset by which lipid probe was used in the pulldown and by significance thresholds.

:::{.border}
```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Here is the code to make the filterable lists shown in the crosstalk table below

## Creates a reactive dataframe
data_reactive <- crosstalk::SharedData$new(data)


htmltools::tags$div(
  class = "filter-container",
  filter_checkbox(id = "LipidProbe",
                  label = "Lipid probe in pulldown:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~LipidProbe),
  filter_checkbox(id = "hit_annotation",
                  label = "Enrichment criteria:", 
                  sharedData = data_reactive,
                  group = ~hit_annotation)
)

## Displays the reactive dataframe
datatable(data_reactive, options = list(pageLength = 10))

```

This datatable contains all the data plotted above. Check the boxes below to filter the dataset by which lipid probe was used in the pulldown and by significance thresholds. 'No hit' proteins are unenriched or depleted in the presence of probe, 'enriched candidates' are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.2 and a fold change of at least 1.5-fold, and 'enriched hits' are defined as proteins with a false discovery rate less than 0.05 and a fold change of at least 2-fold in the +UV over the -UV.

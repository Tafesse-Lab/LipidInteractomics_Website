  abstract = {Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon-stimulated gene that converts cholesterol to the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). Circulating 25HC modulates essential immunological processes including antiviral immunity, inflammasome activation and antibody class switching; and dysregulation of CH25H may contribute to chronic inflammatory disease and cancer. Although 25HC is a potent regulator of cholesterol storage, uptake, efflux and biosynthesis, how these metabolic activities reprogram the immunological state of target cells remains poorly understood. Here, we used recently designed toxin-based biosensors that discriminate between distinct pools of plasma membrane cholesterol to elucidate how 25HC prevents Listeria monocytogenes from traversing the plasma membrane of infected host cells. The 25HC-mediated activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) triggered rapid internalization of a biochemically defined fraction of cholesterol, termed ‘accessible’ cholesterol, from the plasma membrane while having little effect on cholesterol in complexes with sphingomyelin. We show that evolutionarily distinct bacterial species, L. monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri, exploit the accessible pool of cholesterol for infection and that acute mobilization of this pool by oxysterols confers immunity to these pathogens. The significance of this signal-mediated membrane remodelling pathway probably extends beyond host defence systems, as several other biologically active oxysterols also mobilize accessible cholesterol through an ACAT-dependent mechanism.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) has been a transmittable human disease for many thousands of years, and M. tuberculosis is again the number one cause of death worldwide due to a single infectious agent. The intense 6- to 10-month process of multi-drug treatment, combined with the adverse side effects that can run the spectrum from gastrointestinal disturbances to liver toxicity or peripheral neuropathy are major obstacles to patient compliance and therapy completion. The consequent increase in multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) cases requires that we increase our arsenal of effective drugs, particularly novel therapeutic approaches. Over the millennia, host and pathogen have evolved mechanisms and relationships that greatly influence the outcome of infection. Understanding these evolutionary interactions and their impact on bacterial clearance or host pathology will lead the way toward rational development of new therapeutics that favor enhancing a host protective response. These host-directed therapies have recently demonstrated promising results against M. tuberculosis, adding to the effectiveness of currently available anti-mycobacterial drugs that directly kill the organism or slow mycobacterial replication. Here we review the host-pathogen interactions during M. tuberculosis infection, describe how M. tuberculosis bacilli modulate and evade the host immune system, and discuss the currently available host-directed therapies that target these bacterial factors. Rather than provide an exhaustive description of M. tuberculosis virulence factors, which falls outside the scope of this review, we will instead focus on the host-pathogen interactions that lead to increased bacterial growth or host immune evasion, and that can be modulated by existing host-directed therapies.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis can be induced via the engagement of Fcγ receptors by antibody-opsonized material. Furthermore, the efficiency of antibody-induced effector functions has been shown to be dramatically modulated by changes in antibody glycosylation. Because infection can modulate antibody glycans, which in turn modulate antibody functions, assays capable of determining the induction of effector functions rather than neutralization or titer provide a valuable opportunity to more fully characterize the quality of the adaptive immune response. Here we describe a robust and high-throughput flow cytometric assay to define the phagocytic activity of antigen-specific antibodies from clinical samples. This assay employs a monocytic cell line that expresses numerous Fc receptors: including inhibitory and activating, and high and low affinity receptors-allowing complex phenotypes to be studied. We demonstrate the adaptability of this high-throughput, flow-based assay to measure antigen-specific antibody-mediated phagocytosis against an array of viruses, including influenza, HIV, and dengue. The phagocytosis assay format further allows for simultaneous analysis of cytokine release, as well as determination of the role of specific Fcγ-receptor subtypes, making it a highly useful system for parsing differences in the ability of clinical and vaccine induced antibody samples to recruit this critical effector function. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

D609 actions are widely attributed to inhibiting phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). D609 also inhibits sphingomyelin synthase (SMS). PC-PLC and/or SMS inhibition will affect lipid second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and/or ceramide. Evidence indicates either PC-PLC and/or SMS inhibition affected the cell cycle and arrested proliferation, and stimulated differentiation in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Xanthogenate compounds are also potent antioxidants and D609 reduced Aβ-induced toxicity, attributed to its antioxidant properties. Zn 2+ is necessary for PC-PLC enzymatic activity; inhibition by D609 might be attributed to its Zn 2+ chelation. D609 has also been proposed to inhibit acidic sphingomyelinase or down-regulate hypoxia inducible factor-1α; however these are downstream events related to PC-PLC inhibition. Characterization of the mammalian PC-PLC is limited to inhibition of enzymatic activity (frequently measured using Amplex red assay with bacterial PC-PLC as a standard). The mammalian PC-PLC has not been cloned; sequenced and structural information is unavailable. D609 showed promise in cancer studies, reduced atherosclerotic plaques (inhibition of PC-PLC) and cerebral infarction after stroke (PC-PLC or SMS). D609 actions as an antagonist to pro-inflammatory cytokines have been attributed to PC-PLC. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively evaluate the literature and summarize the findings and relevance to cell cycle and CNS pathologies.},

They are macrophages filled with lipid laden droplets, which are synthesised in response to increased uptake of extracellular lipids, metabolic changes and infection itself. They share the appearance with atherosclerosis foam cells, but their lipid contents and roles are different. In fact, lipid droplets are immune and metabolic organelles with emerging roles in Tuberculosis.

However, CR3-mediated phagocytosis of some Gram-negative bacteria does not induce bacterial clearance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella and Escherichia coli are eliminated after phagocytic cell-bacteria interaction mediated by CR3. However, Bordetella takes advantage of the CR3 function and uses it to enter into macrophages leading to bacterial survival.

Lipids significantly induced the expression of 368 genes. A main core lipid response was observed involving efflux systems, iron caption and sulfur reduction. In co-expression with ncRNAs and other genes discussed below, may act coordinately to prepare the machinery conferring drug tolerance and increasing a persistent population. Our findings could be useful to tag relevant pathways for the development of new drugs, vaccines and new strategies to control TB.},

  abstract = {Significance             Ceramide is a bioactive lipid involved in numerous cellular functions and disease states that are critically dependent on its site of generation. nSMase2 generates ceramide at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and is a therapeutic target for cancer and neurological disorders. Although much is known about the cellular functions of nSMase2, there is limited insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating its activity. Here we present the crystal structure of nSMase2 and identify the lipid-binding N-terminal domain as an allosteric activation domain. Key to activation is a catalytic motif termed the “DK switch,” whose conformation is allosterically gated. This study reveals one mechanism for nSMase2 regulation by lipids and will help guide structure-based development of nSMase2-targeted therapeutics.           ,                             Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2, product of the               SMPD3               gene) is a key enzyme for ceramide generation that is involved in regulating cellular stress responses and exosome-mediated intercellular communication. nSMase2 is activated by diverse stimuli, including the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine binds to an integral-membrane N-terminal domain (NTD); however, how the NTD activates the C-terminal catalytic domain is unclear. Here, we identify the complete catalytic domain of nSMase2, which was misannotated because of a large insertion. We find the soluble catalytic domain interacts directly with the membrane-associated NTD, which serves as both a membrane anchor and an allosteric activator. The juxtamembrane region, which links the NTD and the catalytic domain, is necessary and sufficient for activation. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic basis for this phenomenon using the crystal structure of the human nSMase2 catalytic domain determined at 1.85-Å resolution. The structure reveals a DNase-I–type fold with a hydrophobic track leading to the active site that is blocked by an evolutionarily conserved motif which we term the “DK switch.” Structural analysis of nSMase2 and the extended N-SMase family shows that the DK switch can adopt different conformations to reposition a universally conserved Asp (D) residue involved in catalysis. Mutation of this Asp residue in nSMase2 disrupts catalysis, allosteric activation, stimulation by phosphatidylserine, and pharmacological inhibition by the lipid-competitive inhibitor GW4869. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the DK switch regulates ceramide generation by nSMase2 and is governed by an allosteric interdomain interaction at the membrane interface.},

  abstract = {In this study, we establish that cholesterol and sphingolipid associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles are important for virion maturation and infectivity. In a recently developed culture system enabling study of the complete life cycle of HCV, mature virions were enriched with cholesterol as assessed by the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid in virion and cell membranes. Depletion of cholesterol from the virus or hydrolysis of virion-associated sphingomyelin almost completely abolished HCV infectivity. Supplementation of cholesterol-depleted virus with exogenous cholesterol enhanced infectivity to a level equivalent to that of the untreated control. Cholesterol-depleted or sphingomyelin-hydrolyzed virus had markedly defective internalization, but no influence on cell attachment was observed. Significant portions of HCV structural proteins partitioned into cellular detergent-resistant, lipid-raft-like membranes. Combined with the observation that inhibitors of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway block virion production, but not RNA accumulation, in a JFH-1 isolate, our findings suggest that alteration of the lipid composition of HCV particles might be a useful approach in the design of anti-HCV therapy.},

  abstract = {Pathogenomic evidence suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) evolved from an environmental ancestor similar to Mycobacterium canettii, a rare human pathogen. Although the adaptations responsible for this transition are poorly characterized, the ability to persist in humans seems to be important. We set out to identify the adaptations contributing to the evolution of persistence in MTB. We performed an experimental evolution of eight M. canettii populations in mice; four populations were derived from the isolate STB-K (phylogenomically furthest from MTB) and four from STB-D (closest to MTB), which were monitored for 15 and 6 cycles, respectively. We selected M. canettii mutants with enhanced persistence in vivo compared with the parental strains, which were phenotypically closer to MTB. Genome sequencing of 140 mutants and complementation analysis revealed that mutations in two loci were responsible for enhanced persistence. Most of the tested mutants were more resistant than their parental strains to nitric oxide, an important effector of immunity. Modern MTB were similarly more resistant to nitric oxide than M. canettii. Our findings demonstrate phenotypic convergence during experimental evolution of M. canettii, which mirrors natural evolution of MTB. Furthermore, they indicate that the ability to withstand host-induced stresses was key for the emergence of persistent MTB.},

The modulation of the lipid metabolism has been implicated in the immune response regulation, including the formation of lipid droplets (LD)s, LD-phagosome association and eicosanoid synthesis.               Mtb               ,               M. bovis               BCG and other pathogenic mycobacteria, as well as wall components, such as LAM, can induce LDs formation in a mechanism involving surface receptors, for instance TLRs, CD36, CD14, CD11b/CD18 and others. In addition, the activation of the lipid-activated nuclear receptor PPARγ is involved in the mechanisms of LD biogenesis, as well as in the modulation of the synthesis of lipid mediators. In infected cells, LDs are sites of compartmentalized prostaglandin E               2               synthesis involved in macrophage deactivation, bacterial replication and regulation of the host cytokine profile. LDs also have a function in vesicle traffic during infection. Rab7 and RILP, but not Rab5, are located on LDs of infected macrophages, suggesting that LDs and phagosomes could exchange essential proteins for phagosomal maturation, interfering in mycobacterial survival. The pharmacological inhibition of LDs biogenesis affects the bacterial replication and the synthesis of lipid mediators and cytokines, suggesting that LDs may be new targets for antimicrobial therapies. However, it is still controversial if the accumulation of LDs favors the mycobacterial survival acting as an escape mechanism, or promotes the host resistance to infection. Thus, in this mini-review we discuss recent advances in understanding the important role of LDs in the course of infections and the implications for the pathophysiology of mycobacteriosis.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replicates its genome on specialized endoplasmic reticulum modified membranes termed membranous web and utilizes lipid droplets for initiating the viral nucleocapsid assembly. HCV maturation and/or the egress pathway requires host sphingolipid synthesis, which occur in the Golgi. Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) play a crucial role in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Protein kinase D (PKD), a serine/threonine kinase, is recruited to the trans-Golgi network where it influences vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane by regulation of several important mediators via phosphorylation. PKD attenuates the function of both CERT and OSBP by phosphorylation at their respective Ser132 and Ser240 residues (phosphorylation inhibition). Here, we investigated the functional role of PKD in HCV secretion. Our studies show that HCV gene expression downregulated PKD activation. PKD depletion by shRNA or inhibition by pharmacological inhibitor Gö6976 enhanced HCV secretion. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of PKD suppressed HCV secretion. The suppression by PKD was subverted by the ectopic expression of nonphosphorylatable serine mutant CERT S 132A or OSBP S240A. These observations imply that PKD negatively regulates HCV secretion/release by attenuating OSBP and CERT functions by phosphorylation inhibition. This study identifies the key role of the Golgi components in the HCV maturation process. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {Introduction: SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2), which causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was first detected in China in late 2019 and has since then caused a global pandemic. While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These assays were developed with negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from COVID19 patients. Results: The assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as 3 days post symptom onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Conclusion: Serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Clinical Trial This is not a clinical trial, just development of a serological assay. \#\#\# Funding Statement Mount Sinai Health System Translational Science Hub (NIH grant U54TR001433) for supporting sample collection.

The alpha and epsilon Proteobacteria, including the important human pathogens Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Bartonella bacilliformis, require flagellar motility to efficiently infect mammalian hosts. In this study, we demonstrate that these bacteria make flagellin molecules that are not recognized by TLR5. We map the site responsible for TLR5 evasion to amino acids 89-96 of the N-terminal D1 domain, which is centrally positioned within the previously defined TLR5 recognition site. Salmonella flagellin is strongly recognized by TLR5, but mutating residues 89-96 to the corresponding H. pylori flaA sequence abolishes TLR5 recognition and also destroys bacterial motility. To preserve bacterial motility, alpha and epsilon Proteobacteria possess compensatory amino acid changes in other regions of the flagellin molecule, and we engineer a mutant form of Salmonella flagellin that evades TLR5 but retains motility. These results suggest that TLR5 evasion is critical for the survival of this subset of bacteria at mucosal sites in animals and raise the intriguing possibility that flagellin receptors provided the selective force to drive the evolution of these unique subclasses of bacterial flagellins.},

Th1 and Th17 cells lacking the TIM-1 mucin domain showed reduced rolling in thrombin-activated mesenteric venules and inflamed brain microcirculation. Inhibition of TIM-1 had no effect on naive Tcell homing, but it reduced Tcell recruitment in a skin hypersensitivitymodel and blocked experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Uniquely, the TIM-1 immunoglobulin variable domain was also required for P-selectin binding.

Here, we report that the intestinal microbe Bacteroides fragilis modifies the homeostasis of host invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells by supplementing the host's endogenous lipid antigen milieu with unique inhibitory sphingolipids. The process occurs early in life and effectively impedes iNKT cell proliferation during neonatal development. Consequently, total colonic iNKT cell numbers are restricted into adulthood, and hosts are protected against experimental iNKT cell-mediated, oxazolone-induced colitis. In studies with neonatal mice lacking access to bacterial sphingolipids, we found that treatment with B. fragilis glycosphingolipids - exemplified by an isolated peak (MW = 717.6) called GSL-Bf717 - reduces colonic iNKT cell numbers and confers protection against oxazolone-induced colitis in adulthood. Our results suggest that the distinctive inhibitory capacity of GSL-Bf717 and similar molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and allergic disorders in which iNKT cell activation is destructive.

  abstract = {Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite involved in many critical cell processes. It is produced by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) and exported out of cells via transporters such as spinster homolog 2 (Spns2). S1P regulates diverse physiological processes by binding to specific G protein-binding receptors, S1P receptors (S1PRs) 1–5, through a process coined as “inside-out signaling.” The S1P concentration gradient between various tissues promotes S1PR1-dependent migration of T cells from secondary lymphoid organs into the lymphatic and blood circulation. S1P suppresses T cell egress from and promotes retention in inflamed peripheral tissues. S1PR1 in T and B cells as well as Spns2 in endothelial cells contributes to lymphocyte trafficking. FTY720 (Fingolimod) is a functional antagonist of S1PRs that induces systemic lymphopenia by suppression of lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs. In this review, we summarize previous findings and new discoveries about the importance of S1P and S1PR signaling in the recruitment of immune cells and lymphocyte retention in inflamed tissues. We also discuss the role of S1P-S1PR1 axis in inflammatory diseases and wound healing.},

  abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been implicated in growth factor signal transduction and vesicular membrane traffic. It is thought to mediate the earliest steps leading from ligation of cell surface receptors to increased cell surface ruffling. We show here that inhibitors of PI 3-kinase inhibit endocytosis in macrophages, not by interfering with the initiation of the process but rather by preventing its completion. Consistent with earlier studies, the inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited fluid-phase pinocytosis and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, but they had little effect on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of diI-labeled, acetylated, low density lipoprotein. Large solute probes of endocytosis reported greater inhibition by wortmannin than smaller probes did, indicating that macropinocytosis was affected more than micropinocytosis. Since macropinocytosis and phagocytosis are actin-mediated processes, we expected that their inhibition by wortmannin resulted from deficient signaling from macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptors or Fc receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. However, video microscopy showed cell surface ruffling in wortmannin-treated cells, and increased ruffling after addition of M-CSF or phorbol myristate acetate. Quantitative measurements of video data reported slightly diminished ruffling in wortmannin-treated cells. Remarkably, the ruffles that formed in wortmannin-treated macrophages all receded into the cytoplasm without closing into macropinosomes. Similarly, wortmannin and LY294002 did not inhibit the extension of actin-rich pseudopodia along IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes, but instead prevented them from closing into phagosomes. These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase is not necessary for receptor-mediated stimulation of pseudopod extension, but rather functions in the closure of macropinosomes and phagosomes into intracellular organelles.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids are essential components of cell membranes, and many of them regulate vital cell functions. In particular, ceramide plays crucial roles in cell signaling processes. Two major actions of ceramides are the promotion of cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. Phosphorylation of ceramide produces ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), which has opposite effects to ceramide. C1P is mitogenic and has prosurvival properties. In addition, C1P is an important mediator of inflammatory responses, an action that takes place through stimulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, and the subsequent release of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin formation. All of the former actions are thought to be mediated by intracellularly generated C1P. However, the recent observation that C1P stimulates macrophage chemotaxis implicates specific plasma membrane receptors that are coupled to Gi proteins. Hence, it can be concluded that C1P has dual actions in cells, as it can act as an intracellular second messenger to promote cell survival, or as an extracellular receptor agonist to stimulate cell migration. © 2010 Arana et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We have examined the relationship between host resistance and pathogen virulence using mice with a functional allele of the nramp-1 gene and lacking combinations of TLRs. Mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4 were highly susceptible to the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, consistent with reduced innate immune function. However, mice lacking additional TLRs involved in S. typhimurium recognition were less susceptible to infection. In these TLR-deficient cells, bacteria failed to upregulate Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes and did not form a replicative compartment. We demonstrate that TLR signaling enhances the rate of acidification of the Salmonella-containing phagosome, and inhibition of this acidification prevents SPI-2 induction. Our results indicate that S. typhimurium requires cues from the innate immune system to regulate virulence genes necessary for intracellular survival, growth, and systemic infection.

Immunization of newly weaned piglets with UV-killed pandemic H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (kCA04) SI virus and α-GalCer induced high titers of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies and generated virus-specific T cells that localized in intrapulmonary airways and in alveolar walls. Vaccination with α-GalCer resulted in a systemic increase in NKT-cell concentrations, including in the respiratory tract, which was associated with complete inhibition of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and much reduced viral shedding.

We now demonstrate that the ability of dengue NS5 to associate with and degrade STAT2 is species specific. Thus, NS5 is able to bind and degrade human STAT2, but not mouse STAT2. This difference was exploited to demonstrate, absent manipulation of the viral genome, that NS5-mediated IFN antagonism is essential for efficient virus replication. Moreover, we demonstrate that differences in NS5 mediated binding and degradation between human and mouse STAT2 maps to a region within the STAT2 coiled-coil domain. By using STAT2 -/- mice, we also demonstrate that mouse STAT2 restricts early dengue virus replication in vivo. These results suggest that overcoming this restriction through transgenic mouse technology may help in the development of a long-sought immune-competent mouse model of dengue virus infection. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

None of these effects require cathepsin C, nor are they accompanied by rupture of lysosomes, but they are mimicked by structurally unrelated weak bases. GPN-evoked increases in [Ca 2+ ] c require Ca 2+ within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but they are not mediated by ER Ca 2+ channels amplifying Ca 2+ release from lysosomes. GPN increases [Ca 2+ ] c by increasing pH cyt , which then directly stimulates Ca 2+ release from the ER. We conclude that physiologically relevant increases in pH cyt stimulate Ca 2+ release from the ER in a manner that is independent of IP 3 and ryanodine receptors, and that GPN does not selectively target lysosomes.},

  abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human respiratory pathogen causing annual epidemics as well as periodic pandemics. A complete understanding of the virus pathogenesis and host factors involved in the viral lifecycle is crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the most abundant membrane sphingolipid. It preferentially associates with cholesterol to form distinct domains named lipid rafts. Sphingomyelinases, including acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane SM and consequently transform lipid rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. In this study, we investigated the effect of SM hydrolysis on IAV propagation. Depleting plasma membrane SM by exogenous bacterial SMase (bSMase) impaired virus infection and reduced virus entry, whereas exogenous SM enhanced infection. Moreover, the depletion of virus envelope SM also reduced virus infectivity and impaired its attachment and internalization. Nonetheless, inhibition of ASMase by desipramine did not affect IAV infection. Similarly, virus replication was not impaired in Niemann-Pick disease type A (NPA) cells, which lack functional ASMase. IAV infection in A549 cells was associated with suppression of ASMase activity starting at 6 h post-infection. Our data reveals that intact cellular and viral envelope SM is required for efficient IAV infection. Therefore, SM metabolism can be a potential target for therapeutic intervention against influenza virus infection.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils, constituting the first line of defense, perform vital functions during immune surveillance. A key feature that assists in their prompt response to an inflammatory signal is rapid migration to the affected site. They are normally short-lived but can be activated to live longer under the influence of an inflammatory stimulus. They can, thereby, release their toxic granule contents that are differentially housed inside the cytoplasm. Although these events are well characterized in the peripheral circulation, we are still far from fully understanding their recruitment in lungs. Lungs are a reservoir of neutrophils under steady-state. In the event of an infection or injury, they promptly activate and recruit to the alveolar compartment as well as the airways. Lung intravital microscopy has revealed that neutrophils display novel features during steady- and activated-state highlighting key differences in the lung vasculature compared to peripheral sites.

  abstract = {As pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells (DCs), DC-SIGN binds carbohydrate structures on its pathogen ligands and essentially determines host pathogen interactions because it both skews T cell responses and enhances pathogen uptake for cis infection and/or T cell trans-infection. How these processes are initiated at the plasma membrane level is poorly understood. We now show that DC-SIGN ligation on DCs by antibodies, mannan or measles virus (MV) causes rapid activation of neutral and acid sphingomyelinases followed by accumulation of ceramides in the outer membrane leaflet. SMase activation is important in promoting DC-SIGN signaling, but also for enhancement of MV uptake into DCs. DC-SIGN-dependent SMase activation induces efficient, transient recruitment of CD150, which functions both as MV uptake receptor and microbial sensor, from an intracellular Lamp-1+ storage compartment shared with acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) within a few minutes. Subsequently, CD150 is displayed at the cell surface and co-clusters with DC-SIGN. Thus, DC-SIGN ligation initiates SMase-dependent formation of ceramide-enriched membrane microdomains which promote vertical segregation of CD150 from intracellular storage compartments along with ASM. Given the ability to promote receptor and signalosome co-segration into (or exclusion from) ceramide enriched microdomains which provide a favorable environment for membrane fusion, DC-SIGN-dependent SMase activation may be of general importance for modes and efficiency of pathogen uptake into DCs, and their routing to specific compartments, but also for modulating T cell responses. © 2011 Avota et al.},

  abstract = {The glycolipid transfer protein, GLTP, can be found in the cytoplasm, and it has a FFAT-like motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have previously shown that GLTP can bind to a transmembrane ER protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A), which is involved in a wide range of ER functions. We have addressed the mechanisms that might regulate the association between GLTP and the VAP proteins by studying the capacity of GLTP to recognize different N-linked acyl chain species of glucosylceramide. We used surface plasmon resonance and a lipid transfer competition assay to show that GLTP prefers shorter N-linked fully saturated acyl chain glucosylceramides, such as C8, C12, and C16, whereas long C18, C20, and C24-glucosylceramides are all bound more weakly and transported more slowly than their shorter counterparts. Changes in the intrinsic GLTP tryptophan fluorescence blueshifts, also indicate a break-point between C16- and C18-glucosylceramide in the GLTP sensing ability. It has long been postulated that GLTP would be a sensor in the sphingolipid synthesis machinery, but how this mechanistically occurs has not been addressed before. It is unclear what proteins the GLTP VAP association would influence. Here we found that if GLTP has a bound GlcCer the association with VAP-A is weaker. We have also used a formula for identifying putative FFAT-domains, and we identified several potential VAP-interac-tors within the ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis pathways that could be candidates for regulation by GLTP.},

Compared to mammalian sphingolipids, bacterial sphingolipids are characterized by odd chain lengths due to the presence of branched alkyl chains. Additionally, intestinal microbial sphingolipids can migrate from the gut to various host organs, affecting the immune system and metabolism. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between dietary sphingolipids and the gut microbiota is explored, shedding light on their complex relationship.

We report a calcium-stimulated lipid kinase that co-purifies with rat brain synaptic vesicles. This enzyme activity is found only in membrane fractions that contain synaptic vesicle markers. Based on identification of the lipid product as ceramide 1-phosphate and on the finding that ceramide kinase activity co-purifies with synaptic vesicles, the enzyme is proposed to be a ceramide kinase. Kinase activity is stimulated by micromolar concentrations of calcium. Calcium increases the apparent V(max) of the reaction with little effect on the K(m) for ceramide. The vesicular localization of this enzyme, the requirement for ATP, and the stimulation of enzyme activity by micromolar calcium suggest that ceramide phosphorylation may be associated with neurotransmitter release.},

  abstract = {Immunity to one of the four dengue virus (DV) serotypes can increase disease severity in humans upon subsequent infection with another DV serotype. Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DV infection of myeloid cells in vitro by promoting virus entry via Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR), a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, despite decades of investigation, no in vivo model for antibody enhancement of dengue disease severity has been described. Analogous to human infants who receive anti-DV antibodies by transplacental transfer and develop severe dengue disease during primary infection, we show here that passive administration of anti-DV antibodies is sufficient to enhance DV infection and disease in mice using both mouse-adapted and clinical DV isolates. Antibody-enhanced lethal disease featured many of the hallmarks of severe dengue disease in humans, including thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, elevated serum cytokine levels, and increased systemic viral burden in serum and tissue phagocytes. Passive transfer of a high dose of serotype-specific antibodies eliminated viremia, but lower doses of these antibodies or cross-reactive polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies all enhanced disease in vivo even when antibody levels were neutralizing in vitro. In contrast, a genetically engineered antibody variant (E60-N297Q) that cannot bind FcgammaR exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against ADE-induced lethal challenge. These observations provide insight into the pathogenesis of antibody-enhanced dengue disease and identify a novel strategy for the design of therapeutic antibodies against dengue.},

It has been hypothesized that the genus Mycobacterium originated more than 150 million years ago. In the Middle Ages, scrofula, a disease affecting cervical lymph nodes, was described as a new clinical form of TB. The illness was known in England and France as "king's evil", and it was widely believed that persons affected could heal after a royal touch. In 1720, for the first time, the infectious origin of TB was conjectured by the English physician Benjamin Marten, while the first successful remedy against TB was the introduction of the sanatorium cure. The famous scientist Robert Koch was able to isolate the tubercle bacillus and presented this extraordinary result to the society of Physiology in Berlin on 24 March 1882. In the decades following this discovery, the Pirquet and Mantoux tuberculin skin tests, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin BCG vaccine, Selman Waksman streptomycin and other anti-tuberculous drugs were developed.},

Barber               et al.               studied two patients with cancer who developed active TB during PD-1 blockade. Analysis of longitudinal samples available from one of the patients revealed the presence of TB-specific T               H               1 cells before presentation of TB. These results are in line with previous work in mouse TB models, which showed that PD-1 deficiency exacerbated disease. This report indicates that PD-1 blockade for treating tuberculosis in humans may instead worsen the disease.                        ,                             Because of the well-established therapeutic benefit of boosting antitumor responses through blockade of the T cell inhibitory receptor PD-1, it has been proposed that PD-1 blockade could also be useful in infectious disease settings, including               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) infection. However, in preclinical models, Mtb-infected PD-1               −/−               mice mount exaggerated T               H               1 responses that drive lethal immunopathology. Multiple cases of tuberculosis during PD-1 blockade have been observed in patients with cancer, but in humans little is understood about Mtb-specific immune responses during checkpoint blockade–associated tuberculosis. Here, we report two more cases. We describe a patient who succumbed to disseminated tuberculosis after PD-1 blockade for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and we examine Mtb-specific immune responses in a patient with Merkel cell carcinoma who developed checkpoint blockade–associated tuberculosis and was successfully treated for the infection. After anti–PD-1 administration, interferon-γ–producing Mtb-specific CD4 T cells became more prevalent in the blood, and a tuberculoma developed a few months thereafter. Mtb-specific T               H               17 cells, CD8 T cells, regulatory T cells, and antibody abundance did not change before the appearance of the granuloma. These results are consistent with the murine model data and suggest that boosting T               H               1 function with PD-1 blockade may increase the risk or severity of tuberculosis in humans.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (Tb) is a lung infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). With one third of the world population latently infected, it represents the most prevalent bacterial infectious diseases worldwide. Typically, persistence is linked to so-called "dormant" slow-growing bacteria, which have a low metabolic rate and a reduced response to antibiotic treatments. However, dormant bacteria regain growth and virulence when the immune system is weakened, leading again to the active form of the disease. Fatty acids (FAs) released from host triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterols are proposed to serve as sole carbon sources during infection. The metabolism of FAs requires beta-oxidation as well as gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate shunt. Interestingly, the Mtb genome encodes more than hundred proteins involved in the five reactions of beta-oxidation, clearly demonstrating the importance of lipids as energy source. FAs have also been proposed to play a role during resuscitation, the resumption of replicative activities from dormancy. Lipid droplets (LDs) are energy and carbon reservoirs and have been described in all domains. TAGs and sterol esters (SEs) are stored in their hydrophobic core, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. Importantly, host LDs have been described as crucial for several intracellular bacterial pathogens and viruses and specifically translocate to the pathogen-containing vacuole (PVC) during mycobacteria infection. FAs released from host LDs are used by the pathogen as energy source and as building blocks for membrane synthesis. Despite their essential role, the mechanisms by which pathogenic mycobacteria induce the cellular redistribution of LDs and gain access to the stored lipids are still poorly understood. This review describes recent evidence about the dual interaction of mycobacteria with host LDs and membrane phospholipids and integrates them in a broader view of the underlying cellular processes manipulated by various intracellular pathogens to gain access to host lipids.},

Gated transport of solutes across membranes enables cells to establish vital ion gradients and a sophisticated metabolic network. However, an advanced compartmentalization of biochemical reactions makes cells~also particularly vulnerable to membrane damage inflicted by pathogens, chemicals, inflammatory responses or mechanical stress. To avoid potentially lethal consequences of membrane injuries, cells continuously monitor the structural integrity of their membranes and readily activate appropriate pathways to plug, patch, engulf or shed the damaged membrane area. Here, we review recent insights into the cellular mechanisms that underly an effective maintenance of membrane integrity. We discuss how cells respond to membrane lesions caused by bacterial toxins and endogenous pore-forming proteins, with a primary focus on the intimate crosstalk between membrane proteins and lipids during wound formation, detection and elimination. We also discuss how a delicate balance between membrane damage and repair determines cell fate upon bacterial infection or activation of pro-inflammatory cell death pathways.},

  abstract = {The lipid composition of HIV-1 virions is enriched in sphingomyelin (SM), but the roles that SM or other sphingolipids (SLs) might play in the HIV-1 replication pathway have not been elucidated. In human cells, SL levels are regulated by ceramide synthase (CerS) enzymes that produce ceramides, which can be converted to SMs, hexosylceramides, and other SLs. In many cell types, CerS2, which catalyzes the synthesis of very long chain ceramides, is the major CerS. We have examined how CerS2 deficiency affects the assembly and infectivity of HIV-1. As expected, we observed that very long chain ceramide, hexosylceramide, and SM were reduced in CerS2 knockout cells. CerS2 deficiency did not affect HIV-1 assembly or the incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein into virus particles, but it reduced the infectivites of viruses produced in the CerS2-deficient cells. The reduced viral infection levels were dependent on HIV-1 Env, since HIV-1 particles that were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein did not exhibit reductions in infectivity. Moreover, cell-cell fusion assays demonstrated that the functional defect of HIV-1 Env in CerS2-deficient cells was independent of other viral proteins. Overall, our results indicate that the altered lipid composition of CerS2-deficient cells specifically inhibit the HIV-1 Env receptor binding and/or fusion processes.},

This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6’s mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.},

Individuals who previously recovered from COVID-19 have enhanced immune responses after vaccination (hybrid immunity) compared to their naïve-vaccinated peers; however, the effects of post-vaccination breakthrough infections on humoral immune response remain to be determined. Here, we measure neutralizing antibody responses from 104 vaccinated individuals, including those with breakthrough infections, hybrid immunity, and no infection history. We find that human immune sera following breakthrough infection and vaccination following natural infection, broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants to a similar degree. While age negatively correlates with antibody response after vaccination alone, no correlation with age was found in breakthrough or hybrid immune groups. Together, our data suggest that the additional antigen exposure from natural infection substantially boosts the quantity, quality, and breadth of humoral immune response regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

As we’ve previously shown, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), associated with an M1-like proinflammatory macrophage response, potently induce antibiotic tolerance in               S. aureus               . Although the proinflammatory immune response is critical for initial control of pathogen burden, recent studies demonstrate that modulation of the macrophage response to an anti-inflammatory, or M2-like, response facilitates resolution of established               S. aureus               skin and soft tissue infections, arthritis, and bacteremia.

Genetic or systemic inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) is not feasible for treatment of patients or might cause adverse effects. Thus, a manipulation of ceramide specifically in lungs of CF mice must be developed. We tested whether inhalation of different acid sphingomyelinase inhibitors does reduce Asm activity and ceramide accumulation in lungs of CF mice. The efficacy and specificity of the drugs was determined. Ceramide was determined by mass spectrometry, DAG-kinase assays, and fluorescence microscopy. We determined pulmonary and systemic Asm activity, neutral sphingomyelinase (Nsm), ceramide, cytokines, and infection susceptibility. Mass spectroscopy, DAG-kinase assays, and semiquantitative immune fluorescence microscopy revealed that a standard diet did not influence ceramide in bronchial respiratory epithelial cells, while a diet with Peptamen severely affected the concentration of sphingolipids in CF lungs. Inhalation of the Asm inhibitors amitriptyline, trimipramine, desipramine, chlorprothixene, fluoxetine, amlodipine, or sertraline restored normal ceramide concentrations in murine bronchial epithelial cells, reduced inflammation in the lung of CF mice and prevented infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All drugs showed very similar efficacy. Inhalation of the drugs was without systemic effects and did not inhibit Nsm. These findings employing several structurally different Asm in hibitors identify Asm as primary target in the lung to reduce ceramide concentrations. Inhaling an Asm inhibitor may be a beneficial treatment for CF, with minimal adverse systemic effects.},

  abstract = {Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, has been used in the clinic to treat a number of disorders, in particular major depression and neuropathic pain. In the 1970s the ability of tricyclic antidepressants to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) was discovered. The enzyme ASM catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide. ASM and ceramide were shown to play a crucial role in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and major depression, as well as viral (e.g., measles virus) and bacterial (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) infections. Ceramide molecules may act in these diseases by the alteration of membrane biophysics, the self-association of ceramide molecules within the cell membrane and the ultimate formation of larger ceramide-enriched membrane domains/platforms. These domains were shown to serve the clustering of certain receptors such as CD95 and may also act in the above named diseases. The potential to block the generation of ceramide by inhibiting the ASM has opened up new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these conditions. Since amitriptyline is one of the longest used clinical drugs and side effects are well studied, it could potentially become a cheap and easily accessible medication for patients suffering from these diseases. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of current in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials utilizing amitriptyline to inhibit ASM and contemplate possible future applications of the drug.},

To enter the host cell, exported proteins must cross the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) within which the parasite resides, but the mechanism remains unclear. A putative Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) has been suggested to be involved for at least one class of exported proteins; however, direct functional evidence for this has been elusive. Here we show that export across the PVM requires heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a ClpB-like AAA+ ATPase component of PTEX. Using a chaperone auto-inhibition strategy, we achieved rapid, reversible ablation of HSP101 function, resulting in a nearly complete block in export with substrates accumulating in the vacuole in both asexual and sexual parasites. Surprisingly, this block extended to all classes of exported proteins, revealing HSP101-dependent translocation across the PVM as a convergent step in the multi-pathway export process. Under export-blocked conditions, association between HSP101 and other components of the PTEX complex was lost, indicating that the integrity of the complex is required for efficient protein export. Our results demonstrate an essential and universal role for HSP101 in protein export and provide strong evidence for PTEX function in protein translocation into the host cell.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Upon infection, Mtb is phagocytosed by macrophages and uses its virulence-associated ESX-1 secretion system to modulate the host cell. We showed previously that the ESX-1 secretion system perturbs the Mtb-containing phagosome, and a population (;30\%) of intracellular Mtb is tagged with ubiquitin and targeted to selective autophagy. However, our understanding of how macrophages sense and respond to damaged Mtb-containing phagosomes remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that several cytosolic glycan-binding proteins called galectins recognize Mtb-containing phagosomes; in macrophage cell lines and in primary macrophages, galectin-3, -8, and -9 are all recruited to the same Mtb population that colocalizes with selective autophagy markers (ubiquitin, p62, and LC3). To test whether galectins are required for controlling Mtb replication in macrophages, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts and found that galectin-82/2 and galectin-3/8/ 92/2 macrophages were similarly defective in targeting Mtb to selective autophagy and controlling replication. This suggests galectin-8 plays a unique role in anti-Mtb autophagy. In investigating galectin-8's role, we identified a novel and specific interaction between galectin-8 and the selective autophagy adapter TAX1BP1 and found that this galectin-8/TAX1BP1 interaction was necessary for macrophages to efficiently target Mtb to selective autophagy. Remarkably, overexpressing galectin-8 increased targeting of Mtb to autophagy and limited Mtb replication. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while several galectins are capable of recognizing damaged Mtb-containing phagosomes, galectin-8 plays a privileged role in recruiting downstream autophagy machinery and may represent a promising target for host-directed tuberculosis therapies. IMPORTANCE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects one-quarter of the global population and causes one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Macrophages are the first line of defense against Mtb infection and are typically incredibly efficient at destroying intracellular pathogens, but Mtb has evolved to survive and replicate in this harsh environment. Previous work has found that a portion of intracellular Mtb bacilli damage their phagosomes, leaving them vulnerable to detection by the host and delivery to an antibacterial pathway called selective autophagy. Here, we show that in macrophages, galectin-8 recognizes damaged Mtb-containing phagosomes and targets Mtb to selective autophagy; we found that galectin-8, unlike other highly similar and closely related galectins, is required for targeting and controlling Mtb in macrophages. The specific role for galectin-8 appears to stem from its interaction with TAX1BP1, a selective autophagy adapter protein. Interestingly, overexpressing galectin-8 helps macrophages target and control Mtb, highlighting the importance of galectin-8 in the innate immune response to Mtb.},

However, different to its human counterpart, sphingosine was able to open this channel, while other well known sphingolipids had no effect.

This study examined the protein composition and in vivo function of the promastigote flagellum. Protein mass spectrometry and label free protein enrichment testing of isolated flagella and deflagellated cell bodies defined a flagellar proteome for L. mexicana promastigote forms (available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011057). This information was used to generate a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library of 100 mutants to screen for flagellar defects. This first large-scale knockout screen in a Leishmania sp. identified 56 mutants with altered swimming speed (52 reduced and 4 increased) and defined distinct mutant categories (faster swimmers, slower swimmers, slow uncoordinated swimmers and paralysed cells, including aflagellate promastigotes and cells with curled flagella and disruptions of the paraflagellar rod). Each mutant was tagged with a unique 17-nt barcode, providing a simple barcode sequencing (bar-seq) method for measuring the relative fitness of L. mexicana mutants in vivo . In mixed infections of the permissive sand fly vector Lutzomyia longipalpis , paralysed promastigotes and uncoordinated swimmers were severely diminished in the fly after defecation of the bloodmeal. Subsequent examination of flies infected with a single mutant lacking the central pair protein PF16 showed that these paralysed promastigotes did not reach anterior regions of the fly alimentary tract. These data show that L. mexicana need directional motility for successful colonisation of sand flies.},

Decay of label in plasma followed three phases. The first two phases were similar for both isotopes and both types of sphingomyelin (t               1/2               ≃10 and 110 min). However, during the third phase (from 10 hr after injection),               3               H label disappeared more slowly than               14               C label from 18∶0 sphingomyelin, whereas the               3               H/               14               C ratio remained relatively constant when 24∶0 sphingomyelin was used. Intact, doubly‐labeled 18∶0 sphingomyelin disappeared from HDL rapidly (t               1/2               =38 min) by tissue uptake and by transfer to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). VLDL contained up to 12\% of the sphingomyelin 1 hr after injection. This is the first demonstration of a transfer               in vivo               of sphingomyelin from HDL to VLDL. A similarly rapid transfer was also observed               in vitro               . Some nontritated, [               14               C]18∶0 or [               14               C]24∶0 sphingomyelin was redistributed more slowly into HDL. Doubly‐labeled phosphatidylcholine appeared in VLDL and HDL within 1 hr after injection and reached 1.8 and 2.1\% of the injected               14               C and               3               H in VLDL at 1 hr, and 4.8 and 6.9\% in HDL at 3 hr, respectively.},

The clinical efficacy of interferon-gamma has been studied and evaluated in clinical trials since the end of the last century.

  abstract = {The classic pathway for agonist-induced generation of diacylglycerol is via activation of a phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of the "phosphoinositides." We now report findings from a variety of cell types, which indicate that tumor-promoting phorbol diesters, serum, and platelet-derived growth factor activate within seconds the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, as detected by the formation of diacylglycerol and phosphocholine. It is known that phorbol diesters do not stimulate hydrolysis of the phosphoinositides. Yet, in cells prelabeled with either [14C]oleate or [32P]orthophosphate, addition of the tumor promoter phorbol dibutyrate (PBt2) resulted in the rapid generation of both diacylglycerol and phosphatidate in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The fatty acid composition of the phosphatidate most resembled the fatty acid profile of phosphatidylcholine from the same cell type. Taken together, these findings suggested a role for protein kinase C in the generation of diacylglycerol (and phosphatidate) from phosphatidylcholine. To define further the pathways involved, the metabolism of cellular phosphatidylcholine was studied. In cells prelabeled with [3H]choline, addition of PBt2, but not 4 alpha-phorbol, stimulated the formation of intracellular phosphocholine within 45 sec. Furthermore, addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or serum to "serum-starved" cells prelabeled with [3H]choline resulted in increased levels of intracellular phosphocholine within 15-30 sec. Thus, the data suggest that agonists that stimulate protein kinase C either directly (e.g., PBt2) or indirectly via activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (e.g., PDGF and serum) may stimulate degradation of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase C in intact cells. However, prior down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged pretreatment of cells with PBt2 almost totally abolished subsequent stimulation of phosphatidylcholine degradation by PBt2 but only partially attenuated subsequent stimulation by PDGF and serum. These observations suggest that PDGF and serum act, at least partially, through a protein kinase C-independent mechanism. Lastly, the size of the cellular choline and CDP-choline pools were shown to be small and relatively insensitive to agonist addition, as compared to the size and behavior of the phosphocholine pool. Thus, the rapidly increased levels of phosphocholine (and diacylglycerol) arising in response to agonist addition appear to be derived directly from phosphatidylcholine by a phospholipase C-mediated mechanism.},

The current study sought to elucidate the mechanisms linking ceramide accumulation with PP2A activation and determine whether pharmacological inhibition of PP2A in vivo normalizes obesity-associated vascular dysfunction and limits the severity of hypertension. We show in endothelial cells that ceramide associates with the inhibitor 2 of PP2A (I2PP2A) in the cytosol, which disrupts the association of I2PP2A with PP2A leading to its translocation to the plasma membrane. The increased association between PP2A and eNOS at the plasma membrane promotes dissociation of an Akt-Hsp90-eNOS complex that is required for eNOS phosphorylation and activation. A novel small-molecule inhibitor of PP2A attenuated PP2A activation, prevented disruption of the Akt-Hsp90-eNOS complex in the vasculature, preserved arterial function, and maintained normal blood pressure in obese mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby ceramide initiates PP2A colocalization with eNOS and demonstrate that PP2A activation precipitates vascular dysfunction in diet-induced obesity. Therapeutic strategies targeted to reducing PP2A activation might be beneficial in attenuating vascular complications that exist in the context of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and conditions associated with insulin resistance.},

Each kit contains an innovative step by step protocol, which makes them the perfect choice for both experts and beginning teachers. The curriculum contained within the manual for each kit makes our products unique. Each kit contains its own unique curriculum package which is divided into a Teachers Guide and Student Manual. The Teachers Guide is divided into three sections which help to insure that the labs run smoothly. One section contains background information, lecture topics, and sug-gested references which will enable each teacher, both experienced and newcomers to biotechnology, to prepare and design lectures and lessons which can precede the actual labs. This advance preparation will virtually insure that the labs run smoothly and that the students understand the concepts behind each lab. There is a detailed section on the laboratory set up, complete with simple procedures which contain graphic diagrams detailing the advance prepa-ration for the labs. This makes the set up for each lab virtually foolproof. In addition, this sec-tion contains time tables which will help you plan your schedule accordingly. Each lab can be performed in a 50 minute time period, which should fit into most schedules. Finally, we provide a detailed Teachers Answer Guide which contains answers to all of the questions posed in the Student Manual. The teacher can use these answers as a guide when reviewing or grading the questions presented in the Student section of the manual.},

The wet tissue is homogenized with a mixture of chloroform and methanol in such proportions that a miscible system is formed with the water in the tissue. Dilution with chloroform and water separates the homogenate into two layers, the chloroform layer containing all the lipids and the methanolic layer containing all the non-lipids. A purified lipid extract is obtained merely by isolating the chloroform layer. The method has been applied to fish muscle and may easily be adapted to use with other tissues.},

Cif (PA2934), a bacterial toxin secreted in outer membrane vesicles (OMV) by P. aeruginosa, reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion by human airway epithelial cells, a key driving force for mucociliary clearance. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism whereby Cif reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion. Cif redirected endocytosed CFTR from recycling endosomes to lysosomes by stabilizing an inhibitory effect of G3BP1 on the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), USP10, thereby reducing USP10-mediated deubiquitination of CFTR and increasing the degradation of CFTR in lysosomes. This is the first example of a bacterial toxin that regulates the activity of a host DUB. These data suggest that the ability of P. aeruginosa to chronically infect the lungs of patients with COPD, pneumonia, CF, and bronchiectasis is due in part to the secretion of OMV containing Cif, which inhibits CFTR-mediated chloride secretion and thereby reduces the mucociliary clearance of pathogens.},

We here report that the non-lysosomal glu-cosylceramidase is identical to the earlier described bile acid-glucosidase, being-glucosidase 2 (GBA2). Expressed GBA2 is identical to the native non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase in various enzymatic features such as substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. Expression of GBA2 coincides with increased non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity, and GBA2-targeted RNA interference reduces endogenous non-ly-sosomal glucosylceramidase activity in cells. GBA2 is found to be located at or close to the cell surface, and its activity is linked to sphingomyelin generation. Hydrophobic deoxynojirimycins are extremely potent inhibitors for GBA2. In mice pharmacological inhibition of GBA2 activity is associated with impaired spermatogenesis, a phenomenon also very recently reported for GBA2 knockout mice (Yildiz, Y.,},

Chem. 265, 18803-18808) where it may function in terminating the regulatory effects of Cer, and in synaptic vesicles (Bajjalieh, S. M., Martin, T. F. J., and Floor, E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14354-14360). We now demostrate that the addition of both Cer-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) and a short-acyl chain analog of Cer-1-P,N-hexanoylsphingosine-1-phosphate (C6-Cer-1-P) to cultured cells and a variety of subcellular fractions results in rapid degradation to Cer and C6-Cer, respectively. The Cer-1-P phosphatase activity is enriched in a rat liver plasma membrane fraction and appears to be distinct from the phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidic acid (PA), PA phosphohydrolase, as shown by the difference in sensitivity of Cer-1-P and PA hydrolysis to propanolol, detergent, and heat treatment. Moreover, the K(m) of Cer-1-P hydrolysis is 10-fold lower than the K(m) of PA hydrolysis in plasma membrane. PA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Cer-1-P hydrolysis, with an inhibition constant 1-1.5-fold higher than the K(m) of Cer-1-P hydrolysis. In contrast, Cer-1-P does not inhibit PA hydrolysis. Finally, we describe the synthesis of a novel analog of Cer-1-P which is not hydrolyzed in vitro and in vivo and is internalized in cultured cells by endocytosis. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of Cer-1-P in regulating intracellular levels of Cer.},

Sphingomyelinase is a major enzyme in these signaling pathways, catalyzing hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine. To address the related membrane dynamical structural changes and their feedback to enzyme activity, we have studied the effect of enzymatically generated ceramide in situ on the properties of a well-defined lipid model system. We found a gel-phase formation that was about four times faster than ceramide generation due to ceramide-sphingomyelin pairing. The gel-phase formation slowed down when the ceramide molar ratios exceeded those of sphingomyelin and stopped just at the solubility limit of ceramide, due to unfavorable palrwise interactions of ceramide with itself and with monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine. A remarkable correlation to in vitro experiments suggests a regulation of sphingomyelinase activity based on the sphingomyelin/ceramide molar ratio. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

Certain bat species can be productively yet asymptomatically infected with viruses that cause overt disease in other species. However, little is known about the antiviral effector repertoire in bats relative to other mammals. Here, we report the black flying fox receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) as a potent interferon (IFN)-inducible inhibitor of human pathogens in the Flaviviridae family, including Zika, West Nile, and hepatitis C viruses. Mechanistically, RTP4 associates with the flavivirus replicase, binds viral RNA, and suppresses viral genome amplification. Comparative approaches revealed that RTP4 undergoes positive selection, that a flavivirus can mutate to escape RTP4-imposed restriction, and that diverse mammalian RTP4 orthologs exhibit striking patterns of specificity against distinct Flaviviridae members. Our findings reveal an antiviral mechanism that has likely adapted over 100 million years of mammalian evolution to accommodate unique host-virus genetic conflicts.},

The neurologic manifestations of these conditions include parenchymal brain and brainstem disease, myelopathy, radiculopathy, myopathy, and all forms of peripheral neuropathy.

  abstract = {Here, we present the main features of human acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), its biosyn-thesis, processing and intracellular trafficking, its structure, its broad substrate specificity, and the proposed mode of action at the surface of the phospholipid substrate carrying intraendolysosomal luminal vesicles. In addition, we discuss the complex regulation of its phospholipid cleaving activity by membrane lipids and lipid-binding proteins. The majority of the literature implies that ASM hydrolyses solely sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and ignores its ability to degrade further substrates. Indeed, more than twenty different phospholipids are cleaved by ASM in vitro, includ-ing some minor but functionally important phospholipids such as the growth factor ceramide-1-phosphate and the unique lysosomal lysolipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. The inherited ASM deficiency, Niemann-Pick disease type A and B, impairs mainly, but not only, cellular sphingomy-elin catabolism, causing a progressive sphingomyelin accumulation, which furthermore triggers a secondary accumulation of lipids (cholesterol, glucosylceramide, GM2) by inhibiting their turnover in late endosomes and lysosomes. However, ASM appears to be involved in a variety of major cellular functions with a regulatory significance for an increasing number of metabolic disorders. The biochemical characteristics of ASM, their potential effect on cellular lipid turnover, as well as a potential impact on physiological processes will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids and their metabolites play key cellular roles both as structural components of membranes and as signaling molecules that mediate responses to physiologic cues and stresses. Despite progress during the last two decades in defining the enzymatic machinery responsible for synthesizing and degrading sphingolipids, comparatively little is known about how these enzymes are regulated to ensure sphingolipid homeostasis. Here, we review new insights into how cells sense and control sphingolipid biosynthesis and transport. We also discuss emerging evidence that sphingolipid metabolism is closely coordinated with that of sterols and glycerolipids and with other processes that occur in the secretory pathway. An improved understanding of sphingolipid homeostasis promises to shed light on basic processes in cell biology and disease, including how cells establish and maintain the complex membrane composition and architecture that is a defining feature of eukaryotic cell biology. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid metabolism of the ORM genes (known as ORMDL genes in humans)ĝ€"a conserved gene family that includes ORMDL3, which has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in ORM gene expression or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes to the development of childhood asthma. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Zymosan is a beta-glucan- and mannan-rich particle that is widely used as a cellular activator for examining the numerous responses effected by phagocytes. The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) have historically been considered the major macrophage lectins involved in the nonopsonic recognition of these yeast-derived particles. Using specific carbohydrate inhibitors, we show that a beta-glucan receptor, but not the MR, is a predominant receptor involved in this process. Furthermore, nonopsonic zymosan binding was unaffected by genetic CD11b deficiency or a blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CR3, demonstrating that CR3 was not the beta-glucan receptor mediating this activity. To address the role of the recently described beta-glucan receptor, Dectin-1, we generated a novel anti-Dectin-1 mAb, 2A11. Using this mAb, we show here that Dectin-1 was almost exclusively responsible for the beta-glucan-dependent, nonopsonic recognition of zymosan by primary macro-phages. These findings define Dectin-1 as the leukocyte beta-glucan receptor, first described over 50 years ago, and resolves the long-standing controversy regarding the identity of this important molecule. Furthermore, these results identify Dectin-1 as a new target for examining the immunomodulatory properties of beta-glucans for therapeutic drug design.},

  abstract = {Australian unions have adopted new organizing methods to rebuild and develop their organizations. This represents a change in direction from the commitment to partnership and tripartite planning that characterized the Accord period under the Labor governments of the 1980s and 1990s to a new focus on capacity building. A serious decline in union density along with shifts in the labour process has led unions to focus on recruiting and organizing new members. The vitality involved is tempered by a hostile legal climate that supports workplace flexibility, casualization, fragmentation and low-wage work, while curtailing the rights of unions to recruit and organize. This paper explores the common heritage between the new organizing and theories of popular education, radical history and social movement experience. The paper suggests that contemporary efforts to regenerate unions as assertive organizations that rely on developing and educating new activists and leaders can benefit from drawing on emancipatory traditions of popular education, radical history and community organizing, and in so doing avoid an uncritical adoption of what might become simply a new set of organizing techniques.

  abstract = {Like all herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is able to produce lytic or latent infections depending on the host cell type. Lytic infections occur in a broad range of cells while latency is highly specific for neurons. Although latency suggests itself as an attractive target for novel anti-HSV1 therapies, progress in their development has been slowed due in part to a lack of agreement about the basic biochemical mechanisms involved. Among the possibilities being considered is a pathway in which DNA repair mechanisms play a central role. Repair is suggested to be involved in both HSV1 entry into latency and reactivation from it. Here I describe the basic features of the DNA repair-centered pathway and discuss some of the experimental evidence supporting it. The pathway is particularly attractive because it is able to account for important features of the latent response, including the specificity for neurons, the specificity for neurons of the peripheral compared to the central nervous system, the high rate of genetic recombination in HSV1-infected cells, and the genetic identity of infecting and reactivated virus.}

The current treatment regime is long and expensive, and missed doses contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, development of new anti-TB drugs remains one of the highest public health priorities.               Mtb               has evolved a complex cell envelope that represents a formidable barrier to antibiotics. The               Mtb               cell envelop consists of four distinct layers enriched for               Mtb               specific lipids and glycans. Although the outer membrane, comprised of mycolic acid esters, has been extensively studied, less is known about the plasma membrane, which also plays a critical role in impacting antibiotic efficacy. The               Mtb               plasma membrane has a unique lipid composition, with mannosylated phosphatidylinositol lipids (phosphatidyl-myoinositol mannosides, PIMs) comprising more than 50\% of the lipids. However, the role of PIMs in the structure and function of the membrane remains elusive. Here, we used multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the structure-function relationship of the PIM lipid family and decipher how they self-organize to shape the biophysical properties of mycobacterial plasma membranes. We assess both symmetric and asymmetric assemblies of the               Mtb               plasma membrane and compare this with residue distributions of               Mtb               integral membrane protein structures. To further validate the model, we tested known anti-TB drugs and demonstrated that our models agree with experimental results. Thus, our work sheds new light on the organization of the mycobacterial plasma membrane. This paves the way for future studies on antibiotic development and understanding               Mtb               membrane protein function.},

We demonstrate an intimate temporal relationship between European colonial expansion into Africa and the Americas and the spread of L4 tuberculosis (TB). Markedly, in the age of antibiotics, mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance overwhelmingly emerged locally (at the level of nations), with minimal cross-border transmission of resistance. The latter finding was found to reflect the relatively recent emergence of these mutations, as a similar degree of local restriction was observed for susceptible variants emerging on comparable time scales. The restricted international transmission of drug-resistant TB suggests that containment efforts at the level of individual countries could be successful.},

In a population of human macrophages, there are macrophages that restrict Mtb growth and those that do not. However, the sources of heterogeneity in macrophage state during Mtb infection are poorly understood. Here, we perform RNAseq on restrictive and permissive macrophages and reveal that the expression of genes involved in GM-CSF signaling discriminates between the two subpopulations. We demonstrate that blocking GM-CSF makes macrophages more permissive of Mtb growth while addition of GM-CSF increases bacterial control. In parallel, we find that the loss of bacterial control that occurs in HIV-Mtb coinfected macrophages correlates with reduced GM-CSF secretion. Treatment of coinfected cells with GM-CSF restores bacterial control. Thus, we leverage the natural variation in macrophage control of Mtb to identify a critical cytokine response for regulating Mtb survival and identify components of the antimicrobial response induced by GM-CSF.},

  abstract = {Engulfment of extracellular material by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis depends on the ability of cells to generate specialised cup shaped protrusions. To effectively capture and internalise their targets, these cups are organised into a ring or ruffle of actin-driven protrusion encircling a static interior domain. These functional domains depend on the combined activities of multiple Ras and Rho family small GTPases, but how their activities are integrated and differentially regulated over space and time is unknown. Here, we show that the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum coordinates Ras and Rac activity using the multidomain protein RGBARG (RCC1, RhoGEF, BAR and RasGAP-containing protein). We find RGBARG uses a tripartite mechanism of Ras, Rac and phospholipid interactions to localise at the protruding edge and interface with the interior of both macropinocytic and phagocytic cups. There, RGBARG shapes the protrusion by driving Rac activation at the rim whilst suppressing expansion of the active Ras interior domain. Consequently, cells lacking RGBARG form enlarged, flat interior domains unable to form large macropinosomes. During phagocytosis, we find that disruption of RGBARG causes a geometry-specific defect in engulfing rod-shaped bacteria and ellipsoidal beads. This demonstrates the importance of co-ordinating small GTPase activities during engulfment of more complex shapes and thus the full physiological range of microbes, and how this is achieved in a model professional phagocyte.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims—Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional risk factors predict 75-80\% of an individual's risk of incident CVD. However, the role of early life experiences in future disease risk is gaining attention. The Barker hypothesis proposes fetal origins of adult disease, with consistent evidence demonstrating the deleterious consequences of birth weight outside the normal range. In this study, we investigate the role of birth weight in CVD risk prediction. Methods and Results—The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) represents a large national cohort of post-menopausal women with 63 815 participants included in this analysis. Univariable proportional hazards regression analyses evaluated the association of 4 self-reported birth weight categories against 3 CVD outcome definitions, which included indicators of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, carotid artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. The role of birth weight was also evaluated for prediction of CVD events in the presence of traditional risk factors using 3 existing CVD risk prediction equations: one body mass index (BMI)-based and two laboratory-based models. Low birth weight (LBW) ({$<$} 6 lbs.) was significantly associated with all CVD outcome definitions in univariable analyses (HR=1.086, p=0.009). LBW was a significant covariate in the BMI-based model (HR=1.128, p{$<$}0.0001) but not in the lipid-based models. Conclusion—LBW ({$<$}6 lbs.) is independently associated with CVD outcomes in the WHI cohort. This finding supports the role of the prenatal and postnatal environment in contributing to the development of adult chronic disease.},

  abstract = {How viruses are transmitted across the mucosal epithelia of the respiratory, digestive, or excretory tracts, and how they spread from cell to cell and cause systemic infections, is incompletely understood. Recent advances from single virus tracking experiments have revealed conserved patterns of virus movements on the plasma membrane, including diffusive motions, drifting motions depending on retrograde flow of actin filaments or actin tail formation by polymerization, and confinement to submicrometer areas. Here, we discuss how viruses take advantage of cellular mechanisms that normally drive the movements of proteins and lipids on the cell surface. A concept emerges where short periods of fast diffusive motions allow viruses to rapidly move over several micrometers. Coupling to actin flow supports directional transport of virus particles during entry and cell-cell transmission, and local confinement coincides with either nonproductive stalling or infectious endocytic uptake. These conserved features of virus-host interactions upstream of infectious entry offer new perspectives for anti-viral interference. © 2009 Burckhardt, Greber.},

In this narrative review the origins of tuberculosis are outlined, according to the evidence of paleopathology. In particular the first cases of human TB in ancient skeletal remains are presented, together with the most recent discoveries resulting from the paleomicrobiology of the tubercle bacillus, which provide innovative information on the history of TB. The paleopathological evidence of TB attests the presence of the disease starting from Neolithic times. Traditionally, it was thought that TB has a zoonotic origin, being acquired by humans from cattle during the Neolithic revolution. However, the biomolecular studies proposed a new evolutionary scenario demonstrating that human TB has a human origin. The researches show that the disease was present in the early human populations of Africa at least 70000 years ago and that it expanded following the migrations of Homo sapiens out of Africa, adapting to the different human groups. The demographic success of TB during the Neolithic period was due to the growth of density and size of the human host population, and not the zoonotic transfer from cattle, as previously hypothesized. These data demonstrate a long coevolution of the disease and its human host. Understanding the changes of TB through time thanks to the advances in the field of paleopathology can help to solve the present problems and understand the future evolution of TB.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids represent a class of diverse bioactive lipid molecules that are increasingly appreciated as key modulators of diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic processes that include cell growth, cell death, autophagy, angiogenesis, and stress and inflammatory responses. Sphingomyelinases and ceramidases are key enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism that regulate the formation and degradation of ceramide, one of the most intensely studied classes of sphingolipids. Improved understanding of these enzymes that control not only the levels of ceramide but also the complex interconversion of sphingolipid metabolites has provided the foundation for the functional analysis of the roles of sphingolipids. Our current understanding of the roles of various sphingolipids in the regulation of different cellular processes has come from loss-of-function/gain-of-function studies utilizing genetic deletion/ downregulation/overexpression of enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism (e.g. knockout animals, RNA interference) and from the use of pharmacologic inhibitors of these same enzymes. While genetic approaches to evaluate the functional roles of sphingolipid enzymes have been instrumental in advancing the field, the use of pharmacologic inhibitors has been equally important in identifying new roles for sphingolipids in important cellular processes.The latter also promises the development of novel therapeutic targets with implications for cancer therapy, inflammation, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we focus on the status and use of pharmacologic compounds that inhibit sphingomyelinases and ceramidases, and we will review the history, current uses and future directions for various small molecule inhibitors, and will highlight studies in which inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes have been used to effectively treat models of human disease. © 2011 The British Pharmacological Society.},

Therefore, SphKs represent potential new targets for developing novel therapeutics for these diseases. The history and development of SphK inhibitors are discussed, summarizing SphK inhibitors by their structures, and describing some applications of SphK inhibitors. We concluded: i) initial SphK inhibitors based on sphingosine have low specificity with several important off-targets. Identification the off-targets that would work synergistically with SphKs, and developing compounds that target the unique C4 domain of SphKs should be the focus of future studies. ii) The modifications of SphK inhibitors, which are devoted to increasing the selectivity to one of the two isoforms, now focus on the alkyl length, the spacer between the head and linker rings, and the insertion and the position of lipidic group in tail region. iii) SphK/S1P signaling pathway holds therapeutic values for many diseases. To find the exact function of each isoform of SphKs increasing the number of SphK inhibitor clinical trials is necessary.},

Using this approach, we identified host factors essential for infection with influenza and genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. We also identified genes needed for the action of cytolethal distending toxin, including a cell-surface protein that interacts with the toxin. This approach has both conceptual and practical parallels with genetic approaches in haploid yeast.}

  abstract = {The complement and immunoglobulin receptors are the major phagocytic receptors involved during infection. However, only immunoglobulin-dependent uptake results in a respiratory burst and an inflammatory response in macrophages. Rho guanosine triphosphatases (molecular switches that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton) were found to be essential for both types of phagocytosis. Two distinct mechanisms of phagocytosis were identified: Type I, used by the immunoglobulin receptor, is mediated by Cdc42 and Rac, and type II, used by the complement receptor, is mediated by Rho. These results suggest a molecular basis for the different biological consequences that are associated with phagocytosis.},

Beyond a pure barrier separating the inner space of the cell from the outer, the plasma membrane is a scaffold and player in cell-to-cell communication and the initiation of intracellular signals among other functions. Critical to this function is the plasma membrane compartmentalization in lipid microdomains that control the localization and productive interactions of proteins involved in cell signal propagation. In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose integrity and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells. Therefore, we explore the therapeutic potential of manipulating membrane lipid composition with approaches like membrane lipid therapy, aiming to normalize cell functions through the modification of membrane lipid bilayers.},

  abstract = {Synthesis of VLCFAs (very long chain fatty acids) and biosynthesis of DHS (dihydrosphingosine) both are of vital importance for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The bulk of VLCFAs and DHS are used for ceramide synthesis by the Lag1p (longevity-assurance gene 1)/Lac1p (longevity-assurance gene cognate 1)/Lip1p (Lag1p/Lac1p interacting protein) ceramide synthase. LAG1 and LAC1 are redundant but LIP1 is essential. Here we show that 4Δ (lag1Δlac1Δypc1Δydc1Δ) cells devoid of all known endogenous ceramide synthesis pathways are unviable but can be rescued by the expression of Lass5, a mouse LAG1 homologue. Ceramide synthase activity of 4Δ.Lass5 cells only utilizes C16 and C18 fatty acids and does not require the help of Lip1p, an essential cofactor of Lag1p/Lac1p. HPLC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that in IPCs (inositolphosphorylceramides) of 4Δ.Lass5, the very long chain fatty acids (C26 and C24) account for {$<$}1\% instead of the normal {$>$}97\%. Notwithstanding, IPCs incorporated into glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of 4Δ.Lass5 show normal mobility on TLC and the ceramide- and raft-dependent traffic of Gas1p (glycophospholipid-anchored surface protein) from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi remains almost normal. Moreover, the biosynthesis of C24:0 fatty acids remains essential. Thus, C24:0 and dihydrosphingosine are both necessary for survival of yeast cells even if they utilize C16 and C18 fatty acids for sphingolipid biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), is an extremely successful pathogen that adapts to survive within the host. During the latency phase of infection, M. tuberculosis employs a range of effector proteins to be cloud the host immune system and shapes its lifestyle to reside in granulomas, sophisticated, and organized structures of immune cells that are established by the host in response to persistent infection. While normally being restrained in immunocompetent hosts, M. tuberculosis within granulomas can cause the recrudescence of TB when host immunity is compromised. Aside from causing TB, accumulating evidence suggests that M. tuberculosis is also associated with multiple other human diseases, such as pulmonary complications, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, it has been recently appreciated that M. tuberculosis infection can also reciprocally interact with the human microbiome, which has a strong link to immune balance and health. In this review, we highlight the adaptive survival of M. tuberculosis within the host and provide an overview for regulatory mechanisms underlying interactions between M. tuberculosis infection and multiple important human diseases. A better understanding of how M. tuberculosis regulates the host immune system to cause TB and reciprocally regulates other human diseases is critical for developing rational treatments to better control TB and help alleviate its associated comorbidities.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is a principal component of the body's innate immunity in which macrophages internalize targets in an actin-dependent manner. Targets vary widely in shape and size and include particles such as pathogens and senescent cells. Despite considerable progress in understanding this complicated process, the role of target geometry in phagocytosis has remained elusive. Previous studies on phagocytosis have been performed using spherical targets, thereby overlooking the role of particle shape. Using polystyrene particles of various sizes and shapes, we studied phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. We report a surprising finding that particle shape, not size, plays a dominant role in phagocytosis. All shapes were capable of initiating phagocytosis in at least one orientation. However, the local particle shape, measured by tangent angles, at the point of initial contact dictates whether macrophages initiate phagocytosis or simply spread on particles. The local shape determines the complexity of the actin structure that must be created to initiate phagocytosis and allow the membrane to move over the particle. Failure to create the required actin structure results in simple spreading and not internalization. Particle size primarily impacts the completion of phagocytosis in cases where particle volume exceeds the cell volume. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We performed a cell line susceptibility study with 28 cell lines. HCoV-EMC was found to infect the human respiratory tract (polarized airway epithelium cell line Calu-3, embryonic fibroblast cell line HFL, and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549), kidney (embryonic kidney cell line HEK), intestinal tract (colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2), liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7), and histiocytes (malignant histiocytoma cell line His-1), as evident by detection of high or increasing viral load in culture supernatants, detection of viral nucleoprotein expression by immunostaining, and/or detection of cytopathic effects. Although an infected human neuronal cell line (NT2) and infected monocyte and T lymphocyte cell lines (THP-1, U937, and H9) had increased viral loads, their relatively lower viral production corroborated with absent nucleoprotein expression and cytopathic effects. This range of human tissue tropism is broader than that for all other HCoVs, including SARS coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, which may explain the high mortality associated with this disease. A recent cell line susceptibility study showed that HCoV-EMC can infect primate, porcine, and bat cells and therefore may jump interspecies barriers. We found that HCoV-EMC can also infect civet lung fibroblast and rabbit kidney cell lines.

How these metabolic shifts influence the outcome of infection by intracellular pathogens remains incompletely understood.               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) modulates host metabolic pathways and utilizes host nutrients, including cholesterol and fatty acids, to survive within macrophages. We found that intracellular growth of Mtb depends on host fatty acid catabolism: when host fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) was blocked chemically with trimetazidine, a compound in clinical use, or genetically by deletion of the mitochondrial fatty acid transporter carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), Mtb failed to grow in macrophages, and its growth was attenuated in mice. Mechanistic studies support a model in which inhibition of FAO generates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which enhance macrophage NADPH oxidase and xenophagy activity to better control Mtb infection. Thus, FAO inhibition promotes key antimicrobial functions of macrophages and overcomes immune evasion mechanisms of Mtb.

  abstract = {Sphingolipid metabolism is important to balance the abundance of bioactive lipid molecules involved in cell signaling, neuronal function, and survival. Specifically, the sphingolipid sphingosine mediates cell death signaling, whereas its phosphorylated form, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), mediates cell survival signaling. The enzyme sphingosine kinase produces S1P, and the activity of sphingosine kinase impacts the ability of cells to survive under stress and challenges. To examine the influence of sphingolipid metabolism, particularly enzymes regulating sphingosine and S1P, in mediating aging, neuronal function and stress response, we examined life history traits, locomotor capacities and heat stress responses of young and old animals using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans sphk-1 mutants, which lack sphingosine kinase, had shorter lifespans, reduced brood sizes, and smaller body sizes compared to wild type animals. By analyzing a panel of young and old animals with genetic mutations in the sphingolipid signaling pathway, we showed that aged sphk-1 mutants exhibited a greater decline in neuromuscular function and locomotor behavior. In addition, aged animals lacking sphk-1 were more susceptible to death induced by acute and prolonged heat exposure. On the other hand, older animals with loss of function mutations in ceramide synthase (hyl-1), which converts sphingosine to ceramide, showed improved neuromuscular function and stress response with age. This phenotype was dependent on sphk-1. Together, our data show that loss of sphingosine kinase contributes to poor animal health span, suggesting that sphingolipid signaling may be important for healthy neuronal function and animal stress response during aging.},

  abstract = {? 2014, American Society for Microbiology.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an acute human respiratory illness with high morbidity and mortality in 2002-2003. Several studies have demonstrated the role of neutralizing antibodies induced by the spike (S) glycoprotein in protecting susceptible hosts from lethal infection. However, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody response is short-lived in patients who have recovered from SARS, making it critical to develop additional vaccine strategies. SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells persisted for up to 6 years after SARS-CoV infection, a time at which memory B cells and antivirus antibodies were undetectable in individuals who had recovered from SARS. In this study, we assessed the ability of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells to mediate protection against infection in the absence of SARS-CoV-specific memory CD4 T or B cells. We demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells specific for a single immunodominant epitope (S436 or S525) substantially protected 8- to 10-month-old mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection. Intravenous immunization with peptide-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) followed by intranasal boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) encoding S436 or S525 resulted in accumulation of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), lungs, and spleen. Upon challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV, virus-specific memory CD8 T cells efficiently produced multiple effector cytokines (gamma interferon [IFN-?], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-?], and interleukin 2 [IL-2]) and cytolytic molecules (granzyme B) and reduced lung viral loads. Overall, our results show that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells protect susceptible hosts from lethal SARS-CoV infection, but they also suggest that SARS-CoV-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses are necessary for complete protection.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the polarizing potential of currently used human macrophage cell lines, while a better understanding phenomena can support the prediction of effects in vivo based on in vitro analysis. To test the polarization capability of PMA differentiated-THP-1 macrophages (M0), cells were stimulated with 20 ng ml-1 IFNγ + 1 μg ml-1 LPS and 20 ng ml-1 IL-4, which are known to influence macrophage polarization in vivo and ex vivo into the M1 and M2 state, respectively. Apart from several well-known M1 and M2 markers, also new possible markers for M1 and M2 polarization were analysed in this study. The expression of M1 marker genes was up-regulated in IFNγ + LPS stimulated-M0 THP-1 macrophages. The IL-4 stimulated-M0 THP-1 macrophages expressed M2 cell membrane receptor genes. However, M2 chemokine and their receptor genes were only slightly up-regulated which might be due to the complexity of the secondary cell-cell interaction of the chemokine system. Lipopolysaccharides from E. coli (LPS) and food compounds [lentinan, vitamin D3 (vD3) and the combination of lentinan + vitamin D3 (Len + vD3)] were investigated for their polarizing ability on M0 THP-1 macrophages towards either the M1 or M2 state. LPS (700 ng ml-1) was able to skew M0 THP-1 macrophages towards the M1 direction since all analysed M1 marker genes were strongly expressed. Lentinan, vD3 and Len + vD3 did not induce expression of either M1 or M2 markers, indicating no polarizing ability of these compounds. Based on the expression of M1 and M2 marker genes we concluded that THP-1 macrophages could be successfully polarized into either the M1 or M2 state. Therefore, they can be used as a new macrophage polarizing model to estimate the polarizing/switching ability of test food compounds. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

  abstract = {Background A physiological small animal model that resembles COVID-19 with low mortality is lacking. Methods Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option. Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed. Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre. Results The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2. Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge. The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g. Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naïve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss. All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre ≥1:427 fourteen days post-challenge. Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology. No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters. Conclusions Besides satisfying the Koch’s postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of microbes collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. While the gut microbiota provides important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and the group of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via multi-layered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface, thereby allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from epithelial cells that line the intestine. Thus, agents that disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in vitro, might be promoting the increase in inflammatory bowel disease observed since the mid-twentieth century. Here we report that, in mice, relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota encroachment, altered species composition and increased pro-inflammatory potential. Use of germ-free mice and faecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE(S): Soluble Leishmania antigens (SLA) provide suitable protection against leishmaniasis in murine model when delivered by an appropriate delivery system. Liposomes have been shown to be suitable vaccine delivery systems against leishmaniasis, however, the phospholipase-A (PLA) activity of SLA is a drawback to prepare a stable liposomal SLA. One strategy to overcome this problem might be using a lipid which is resistant to PLA activity of SLA such as sphingomyelin (SM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of stable SM liposomes containing SLA on the immune response induced against leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice . MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously, three times with 2-week intervals, with SLA, SM-liposome-SLA, empty liposome or buffer. As criteria for protection, footpads swelling at the site of challenge and foot parasite loads were assessed. The immune responses were also evaluated by determination of IgG subtypes and the level of IFN-γ and IL-4 in cultured splenocytes. RESULTS: The group of mice receiving SM-liposome-SLA, showed a significant large footpad swelling, higher parasite burden in foot and higher IL-4 level compared to the group immunized with buffer. In terms of IgG and IgG isotypes, there was no significant difference between the mice receiving SM-liposome-SLA and the mice that received buffer. Moreover, the immune response induced by SM-liposome-SLA showed no significant difference compared with the one caused by SLA alone. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that SM-liposome-SLA is not an appropriate strategy to induce Th1 immune response and protect the mice against Leishmaniasis; however, SM-liposomes could be suitable vaccine delivery systems when a Th2 response is needed.},

Given that SLs contain various bioactive species possessing distinct roles, quantitative analysis of sphingolipidome is essential for elucidating their differential requirement during development. Herein we developed a comprehensive sphingolipidomic profiling approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with multiple reaction monitoring mode (LC-MS-MRM). SL profiling of C. elegans revealed organism-specific, development-dependent and environment-driven metabolic features. We showed for the first time the presence of a series of sphingoid bases in C. elegans sphingolipid profiles, although only C17-sphingoid base is used for generating complex SLs. Moreover, we successfully resolved growth-, temperature-and nutrition-dependent SL profiles at both individual metabolite-level and network-level. Sphingolipidomic analysis uncovered significant SL composition changes throughout development, with SMs/GluCers ratios dramatically increasing from larva to adult stage whereas total sphingolipid levels exhibiting opposing trends. We also identified a temperature-dependent alteration in SMs/GluCers ratios, suggesting an organism-specific strategy for environmental adaptation. Finally, we found serine-biased GluCer increases between serine-versus alanine-supplemented worms. Our study builds a “reference” resource for future SL analysis in the worm, provides insights into natural variability and plasticity of eukaryotic multicellular sphingolipid composition and is highly valuable for investigating their functional significance.},

In particular, they produce alterations of microdomains that are involved in several cellular processes, ranging from apoptosis to immune response.

In this work, we used the combined approach of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to investigate the effect of Cer chain length in lipid bilayers composed of sphingomyelin, dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. Our results show that only long-chain Cer, like C18 and C16, are able to segregate from the liquid-ordered phase, forming separate Cerenriched domains. Conversely, short-chain Cer do not form a separate phase but alter the physical properties of the liquid-ordered domains, decreasing their stability and viscosity and perturbing the lipid packing. These differences may contribute to the explanation of the different physiological effects that are often observed for the long- and short-chain Cer. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

A deficiency in PPT1 results in a genetic disease, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, associated with massive death of cortical neurons. The role of PPT1 in neuronal survival and apoptosis was studied in human neuroblas-toma (LA-N-5) cells overexpressing PPT1. Overexpression of PPT1 was shown both by the 200-350\% increase in depalmitoylating activity over basal level (as determined by an in vitro PPT assay) and by western blot analysis of transiently expressed epitope-tagged PPT1. Overex-pressed PPT1 showed the same acidic pH optimum (pH 4.0) as the endogenous enzyme, when assayed with a P 0-derived octapeptide substrate, and reduced the growth rate by 30\%. LA-N-5 cells underwent apoptosis, as evi-denced by increased caspase 3-like activity and increased DNA fragmentation, when challenged with either C 2-ceramide or a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Overexpression of PPT1 inhibited this C 2-cer-amide-or LY294002-mediated activation of caspase-3 by 50\%. There was also a concomitant decrease in DNA fragmentation and cell death. Consistent with increased resistance to apoptosis, we found increased phosphorylation of the antiapoptotic protein Akt (protein kinase B) in PPT1-overexpressing cells. p21 Ras is known to be dynamically palmitoylated and depalmitoylated and is involved in both growth and cell death. The C 2-ceramide-induced membrane association of p21 Ras was reduced by 30-50\% in PPT1-overexpressing cells compared with control. PPT overexpression also led to reduced membrane association of another palmitoylated protein, GAP-43, a neuron-specific protein. Our studies suggest that protein palmitoylation could be a physiological regulator of apoptosis.},

We assessed the maturation of the               F. tularensis               phagosome by examining its acquisition of the lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs) CD63 and LAMP1 and the acid hydrolase cathepsin D. Two to four hours after infection, vacuoles containing live               F. tularensis               cells acquired abundant staining for LAMPs but little or no staining for cathepsin D. However, after 4 h, the colocalization of LAMPs with live               F. tularensis               organisms declined dramatically. In contrast, vacuoles containing formalin-killed bacteria exhibited intense staining for all of these late endosomal/lysosomal markers at all time points examined (1 to 16 h). We examined the pH of the vacuoles 3 to 4 h after infection by quantitative immunogold staining and by fluorescence staining for lysosomotropic agents. Whereas phagosomes containing killed bacteria stained intensely for these agents, indicating a marked acidification of the phagosomes (pH 5.5), phagosomes containing live               F. tularensis               did not concentrate these markers and thus were not appreciably acidified (pH 6.7). An ultrastructural analysis of the               F. tularensis               compartment revealed that during the first 4 h after uptake, the majority of               F. tularensis               bacteria reside within phagosomes with identifiable membranes. The cytoplasmic side of the membranes of ∼50\% of these phagosomes was coated with densely staining fibrils of ∼30 nm in length. In many cases, these coated phagosomal membranes appeared to bud, vesiculate, and fragment. By 8 h after infection, the majority of live               F. tularensis               bacteria lacked any ultrastructurally discernible membrane separating them from the host cell cytoplasm. These results indicate that               F. tularensis               initially enters a nonacidified phagosome with LAMPs but without cathepsin D and that the phagosomal membrane subsequently becomes morphologically disrupted, allowing the bacteria to gain direct access to the macrophagic cytoplasm. The capacity of               F. tularensis               to alter the maturation of its phagosome and to enter the cytoplasm is likely an important element of its capacity to parasitize macrophages and has major implications for vaccine development.},

  abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that herpesviruses can exploit the endocytic pathway to infect cells, yet several important features of this process remain poorly defined. Using herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) as a model, we demonstrate that endocytosis of the virions mimic many features of phagocytosis. During entry, HSV-1 virions associated with plasma membrane protrusions followed by a phagocytosis-like uptake involving rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and trafficking of the virions in large phagosome-like vesicles. RhoA GTPase was activated during this process and the mode of entry was cell type–specific. Clathrin-coated vesicles had no detectable role in virion trafficking as Eps15 dominant-negative mutants failed to affect HSV-1 uptake. Binding and fusion of the virion envelope with the phagosomal membrane is likely facilitated by clustering of nectin-1 (or HVEM) in phagosomes, which was observed in infected cells. Collectively, our data suggests a novel mode of uptake by which the virus can infect both professional and nonprofessional phagocytes.},

  abstract = {C1 domains, cysteine-rich modules originally identified in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, are present in multiple signaling families, including PKDs, chimaerins, RasGRPs, diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) and others. Typical C1 domains bind the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and DAG-mimetics such as phorbol esters, and are critical for governing association to membranes. On the contrary, atypical C1 domains possess structural determinants that impede phorbol ester/DAG binding. C1 domains are generally expressed as twin modules (C1A and C1B) or single domains. Biochemical and cellular studies in PKC and PKD isozymes revealed that C1A and C1B domains are non-equivalent as lipid-binding motifs or translocation modules. It has been recently determined that individual C1 domains have unique patterns of ligand recognition, driven in some cases by subtle structural differences. Insights from recent 3-D studies on β2-chimaerin and Munc13-1 revealed that their single C1 domains are sterically blocked by intramolecular interactions, suggesting that major conformational changes would be required for exposing the site of DAG interaction. Thus, it is clear that the protein context plays a major role in determining whether binding of DAG to the C1 domain would lead to enzyme activation or merely serves as an anchoring mechanism. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Functioning and processing of membrane proteins critically depend on the way their transmembrane segments are embedded in the membrane. Sphingolipids are structural components of membranes and can also act as intracellular second messengers. Not much is known of sphingolipids binding to transmembrane domains (TMDs) of proteins within the hydrophobic bilayer, and how this could affect protein function. Here we show a direct and highly specific interaction of exclusively one sphingomyelin species, SM 18, with the TMD of the COPI machinery protein p24 (ref. 2). Strikingly, the interaction depends on both the headgroup and the backbone of the sphingolipid, and on a signature sequence (VXXTLXXIY) within the TMD. Molecular dynamics simulations show a close interaction of SM 18 with the TMD. We suggest a role of SM 18 in regulating the equilibrium between an inactive monomeric and an active oligomeric state of the p24 protein, which in turn regulates COPI-dependent transport. Bioinformatic analyses predict that the signature sequence represents a conserved sphingolipid-binding cavity in a variety of mammalian membrane proteins. Thus, in addition to a function as second messengers, sphingolipids can act as cofactors to regulate the function of transmembrane proteins. Our discovery of an unprecedented specificity of interaction of a TMD with an individual sphingolipid species adds to our understanding of why biological membranes are assembled from such a large variety of different lipids.},

Dendritic cells (DCs) participate in the acute and chronic inflammatory responses to               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) by directing the adaptive immune response and are present in lung granulomas. In macrophages, the interaction of lipid droplets (LDs) with mycobacteria‐containing phagosomes is central to host‐pathogen interactions. However, the data available for DCs are still a matter of debate. Here, we reported that bone marrow‐derived DCs (BMDCs) were susceptible to Mtb infection and replication at similar rate to macrophages. Unlike macrophages, the analysis of gene expression showed that Mtb infection induced a delayed increase in lipid droplet‐related genes and proinflammatory response. Hence, LD accumulation has been observed by high‐content imaging in late periods. Infection of BMDCs with killed H37Rv demonstrated that LD accumulation depends on Mtb viability. Moreover, infection with the attenuated strains H37Ra and               Mycobacterium bovis               ‐BCG induced only an early transient increase in LDs, whereas virulent Mtb also induced delayed LD accumulation. In addition, infection with the BCG strain with the reintroduced virulence RD1 locus induced higher LD accumulation and bacterial replication when compared to parental BCG. Collectively, our data suggest that delayed LD accumulation in DCs is dependent on mycobacterial viability and virulence.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis requires actin assembly and pseudopod extension, two cellular events that coincide spatially and temporally. The signal transduction events underlying both processes may be distinct. We tested whether phagocytic signaling resembles that of growth factor receptors, which induce actin polymerization via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Fcgamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis was accompanied by a rapid increase in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in vivo, and addition of wortmannin (WM) or LY294002, two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase(s), inhibited phagocytosis but not Fcgamma receptor-directed actin polymerization. However, both compounds prevented maximal pseudopod extension, suggesting that PI 3-kinase inhibition produced a limitation in membrane required for pseudopod extension. Availability of plasma membrane was not limiting for phagocytosis, because blockade of ingestion in the presence of WM was not overcome by reducing the number of particles adhering to macrophages. However, decreasing bead size, and hence the magnitude of pseudopod extension required for particle engulfment, relieved the inhibition of phagocytosis in the presence of WM or LY294002 by up to 80\%. The block in phagocytosis of large particles occurred before phagosomal closure, because both compounds inhibited spreading of macrophages on substrate-bound IgG. Macrophage spreading on IgG was accompanied by exocytic insertion of membrane from an intracellular source, as measured by the dye FM1-43. These results indicate that one or more isoforms of PI 3 kinase are required for maximal pseudopod extension but not phagocytosis per se. We suggest that PI 3-kinase is required for coordinating exocytic membrane insertion and pseudopod extension},

  abstract = {Most mycolic acid-containing actinobacteria and some proteobacteria use steroids as growth substrates, but the catabolism of the last two steroid rings has yet to be elucidated. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this pathway includes virulence determinants and has been proposed to be encoded by the Kst R2-regulated genes, which include a predicted coenzyme A (CoA) transferase gene (ipd AB) and an acyl-CoA reductase gene (ipd C). In the presence of cholesterol, Δipd C and Δipd AB mutants of either M. tuberculosis or Rhodococcus jostii strain RHA1 accumulated previously undescribed metabolites: 3aα-H-4α (carboxyl-CoA)-5-hydroxy-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1-indanone (5-OH HIC-CoA) and (R)-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-3-methyl-6-oxocyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA (COCHEA-CoA), respectively. A Δfad E32 mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis accumulated 4-methyl-5-oxo-octanedioic acid (MOODA). Incubation of synthetic 5-OH HIC-CoA with purified Ipd F, Ipd C, and enoyl-CoA hydratase 20 (Ech A20), a crotonase superfamily member, yielded COCHEA-CoA and, upon further incubation with Ipd AB and a CoA thiolase, yielded MOODA-CoA. Based on these studies, we propose a pathway for the final steps of steroid catabolism in which the 5-member ring is hydrolyzed by Ech A20, followed by hydrolysis of the 6-member ring by Ipd AB. Metabolites accumulated by Δipd F and Δech A20 mutants support the model. The conservation of these genes in known steroid-degrading bacteria suggests that the pathway is shared. This pathway further predicts that cholesterol catabolism yields four propionyl-CoAs, four acetyl-CoAs, one pyruvate, and one succinyl-CoA. Finally, a Δipd AB M. tuberculosis mutant did not survive in macrophages and displayed severely depleted CoASH levels that correlated with a cholesterol-dependent toxicity. Our results together with the developed tools provide a basis for further elucidating bacterial steroid catabolism and virulence determinants in M. tuberculosis. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are the only known steroid degraders, but the pathway responsible for degrading the last two steroid rings has yet to be elucidated. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this pathway includes virulence determinants. Using a series of mutants in M. tuberculosis and related bacteria, we identified a number of novel CoA thioesters as pathway intermediates. Analysis of the metabolites combined with enzymological studies establishes how the last two steroid rings are hydrolytically opened by enzymes encoded by the Kst R2 regulon. Our results provide experimental evidence for novel ring-degrading enzymes, significantly advance our understanding of bacterial steroid catabolism, and identify a previously uncharacterized cholesterol-dependent toxicity that may facilitate the development of novel tuberculosis therapeutics.},

VACV is closely related to other orthopoxviruses such as variola virus (the cause of smallpox) and cowpox virus (the virus thought to have been used by Jenner in 1796 when he introduced vaccination to the world). In addition to its seminal role as a human vaccine, VACV has also played several important roles in biological science. The discovery of the VACV RNA polymerase in 1967 was the first description of a nucleic acid polymerase from viruses and prompted searches for similar enzymes in other viruses. Genetically engineered VACVs pioneered the concept that recombinant viruses can be used as live vaccines against other diseases, and VACV has become a popular expression system used worldwide in biomedical research. Finally, studies of VACV interactions with the host cell and the immune system are uncovering new features of cell biology and immunology, and an increasing knowledge of virus pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Background: Targeted genome editing using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has been applied in a large number of plant species. Using a gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) and the CRISPR/Cas9 system, small editing events such as deletions of few bases can be obtained. However larger deletions are required for some applications. In addition, identification and characterization of edited events can be challenging in plants with complex genomes, such as wheat. Results: In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system and developed a protocol that yielded high number of large deletions employing a pair of co-expressed sgRNA to target the same gene. The protocol was validated by targeting three genes, TaABCC6, TaNFXL1 and TansLTP9.4 in a wheat protoplast assay. Deletions of sequences located between the two sgRNA in each gene were the most frequent editing events observed for two of the three genes. A comparative assessment of editing frequencies between a codon-optimized Cas9 for expression in algae, crCas9, and a plant codon-optimized Cas9, pcoCas9, showed more consistent results with the vector expressing pcoCas9. Editing of TaNFXL1 by co-expression of sgRNA pair was investigated in transgenic wheat plants. Given the ploidy of bread wheat, a rapid, robust and inexpensive genotyping protocol was also adapted for hexaploid genomes and shown to be a useful tool to identify homoeolog-specific editing events in wheat. Conclusions: Co-expressed pairs of sgRNA targeting single genes in conjunction with the CRISPR/Cas9 system produced large deletions in wheat. In addition, a genotyping protocol to identify editing events in homoeologs of TaNFXL1 was successfully adapted.},

The L1 diapause of Caenorhabditis elegans, where first-stage larvae arrest in response to a food-less environment, is an excellent system to study this mechanism. We found, through genetic manipulation and lipid analysis, that biosynthesis of ceramide, particularly those with longer fatty acid side chains, critically impacts animal survival during L1 diapause. Genetic interaction analysis suggests that ceramide may act in both insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS)-dependent and IISindependent pathways to affect starvation survival. Genetic and expression analyses indicate that ceramide is required for maintaining the proper expression of previously characterized starvation-responsive genes, genes that are regulated by the IIS pathway and tumor suppressor Rb, and genes responsive to pathogen. These findings provide an important insight into the roles of sphingolipid metabolism, not only in starvation response, but also in aging and food-response-related human health problems.},

By measuring and manipulating sphingolipid metabolism using pharmacological and genetic tools in Caenorhabditis elegans, we provide evidence that the synthesis and remodeling of specific ceramides (e.g., dC18:1-C24:1), gangliosides (e.g., GM1-C24:1), and sphingomyelins (e.g., dC18:1-C18:1) influence development rate and lifespan. We found that the levels of fatty acid chain desaturation and elongation in many sphingolipid species increased during development and aging, with no such changes in developmentally-arrested dauer larvae or normal adults after food withdrawal (an anti-aging intervention). Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNAs directed against serine palmitoyl transferase and glucosylceramide synthase acted to slow development rate, extend the reproductive period, and increase lifespan. In contrast, worms fed an egg yolk diet rich in sphingolipids exhibited accelerated development and reduced lifespan. Our findings demonstrate that sphingolipid accumulation and remodeling are critical events that determine development rate and lifespan in the nematode model, with both development rate and aging being accelerated by the synthesis of sphingomyelin, and its metabolism to ceramides and gangliosides.},

  abstract = {Ceramides draw wide attention as tumor suppressor lipids that act directly on mitochondria to trigger apoptotic cell death. However, molecular details of the underlying mechanism are largely unknown. Using a photoactivatable ceramide probe, we here identify the voltage-dependent anion channels VDAC1 and VDAC2 as mitochondrial ceramide binding proteins. Coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations reveal that both channels harbor a ceramide binding site on one side of the barrel wall. This site includes a membrane-buried glutamate that mediates direct contact with the ceramide head group. Substitution or chemical modification of this residue abolishes photolabeling of both channels with the ceramide probe. Unlike VDAC1 removal, loss of VDAC2 or replacing its membrane-facing glutamate with glutamine renders human colon cancer cells largely resistant to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our data support a role of VDAC2 as direct effector of ceramide-mediated cell death, providing a molecular framework for how ceramides exert their anti-neoplastic activity.},

With conventional chemotherapy, PEL continues to portend high mortality, dictating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) represents a key gatekeeper for sphingolipid metabolism, responsible for conversion of ceramides to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). We have previously demonstrated that targeting SphK2 using a novel selective inhibitor, ABC294640, leads to intracellular accumulation of ceramides and induces apoptosis for KSHV-infected PEL cells, while suppressing tumor progression in vivo. In the current study, we sought to determine whether specific ceramide/dh-ceramide species and related ceramide synthases (CerS) impact viability for KSHV-infected PEL cells during targeting of SphK2. We found that several specific ceramide and dihydro(dh)-ceramide species and their associated CerS reduce PEL survival and tumor expansion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that dhC16- Cer induces PEL apoptosis in part through activation of KSHV lytic gene expression. These data further implicate bioactive sphingolipids in regulation of PEL survival, and provide justification for future studies evaluating clinically relevant ceramide analogs or mimetics for their potential as therapeutic agents for PEL.},

  abstract = {Phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and SphK2) generates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid which promotes cancer cell survival and tumor progression in vivo. We have recently reported that targeting SphK2 induces apoptosis for human primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines infected by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and this occurs in part through inhibition of canonical NF-κB activation. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition of SphK2 has minimal impact for uninfected B-cell lines or circulating human B cells from healthy donors. Therefore, we designed additional studies employing primary human endothelial cells to explore mechanisms responsible for the selective death observed for KSHV-infected cells during SphK2 targeting. Using RNA interference and a clinically relevant pharmacologic approach, we have found that targeting SphK2 induces apoptosis selectively for KSHV-infected endothelial cells through induction of viral lytic gene expression. Moreover, this effect occurs through repression of KSHV-microRNAs regulating viral latency and signal transduction, including miR-K12-1 which targets IκBα to facilitate activation of NF-κB, and ectopic expression of miR-K12-1 restores NF-κB activation and viability for KSHV-infected endothelial cells during SphK2 inhibition. These data illuminate a novel survival mechanism and potential therapeutic target for KSHV-infected endothelial cells: SphK2-associated maintenance of viral latency. © 2014 Dai et al.},

In the 1950s, radioisotopic studies demonstrated the high prodution rate and short lifespan of neutrophils and allowed researchers to follow the monocytes as they moved from the marrow through the blood to become tissue macrophages, histiocytes, and dendritic cells. Subsequently, the discovery of the colony-stimulating factors greatly improved understanding the regulation of phagocyte production. The discovery of the microbicidal myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide system and the importance of NADPH oxidase to the generation of H2O2 also stimulated intense interest in phagocyte disorders. More recent research has focused on membrane receptors and the dynamics of the responses of phagocytes to external factors including immunoglobulins, complement proteins, cytokines, chemokines, integrins, and selectins. Phagocytes express toll-like receptors that aid in the clearance of a wide range of microbial pathogens and their products. Phagocytes are also important sources of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus participating in host defenses through a variety of mechanisms. Over the last 50 years, many genetic and molecular disorders of phagocytes have been identified, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of conditions which predispose patients to the risk of recurrent fevers and infectious diseases.},

Because IFN-γ induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and because trophoblast cells are principal targets of LIF in the placenta, we investigated whether and how soluble factors from trophoblast cells regulate the effects of IFN-γ on macrophage activation. IFN-γ reduces macrophage motility, but enhances Stat1 activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and cytotoxic functions. Soluble factors from villous cytotrophoblasts (vCT+LIF cells) and BeWo cells (BW/ST+LIF cells) that were differentiated in the presence of LIF inhibit macrophage Stat1 activation but inversely sustain Stat3 activation in response to IFN-γ. vCT+LIF cells produce soluble factors that induce Stat3 activation; this effect is partially abrogated in the presence of neutralizing anti-interleukin 10 (IL-10) antibodies. Moreover, soluble factors from BW/ST+LIF cells reduce cell proliferation but enhance the migratory responses of monocytes. In addition, these factors reverse the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on monocyte/macrophage motility. BW/ST+LIF cells also generate IFN-γ-activated macrophages with enhanced IL-10 expression, but reduced tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), CD14 and CD40 expression as well as impaired cytotoxic function. Additional assays performed in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies and exogenous IL-10 demonstrate that reduced macrophage cytotoxicity and proliferation, but increased cell motility result from the ability of trophoblast IL-10 to sustain Stat3 activation and suppress IFN-γ-induced Stat1 activation. These in vitro studies are the first to describe the regulatory role of the LIF-trophoblast-IL-10 axis in the process of macrophage activation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.},

Among the lipid-binding proteins of this machinery, we previously identified the four-phosphate adaptor protein FAPP2, the pleckstrin homology domain of which binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and the small GTPase ARF1. FAPP2 also possesses a glycolipid-transfer-protein homology domain. Here we show that human FAPP2 is a glucosylceramide-transfer protein that has a pivotal role in the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids, key structural and signalling components of the plasma membrane. The requirement for FAPP2 makes the whole glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway sensitive to regulation by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and ARF1. Thus, by coupling the synthesis of glycosphingolipids with their export to the cell surface, FAPP2 emerges as crucial in determining the lipid identity and composition of the plasma membrane.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Mycobacterium tuberculosis               enters the host by inhalation of an infectious aerosol and replicates in the alveolar macrophages until the host's immune defense causes bacteriostasis, which leads the pathogen to go into nonreplicative drug-resistant dormancy. The dormant pathogen can survive for decades till the host's immune system is weakened and active tuberculosis develops. Even though fatty acids are thought to be the major energy source required for the persistence phase, the source of fatty acids used is not known. We postulate that the pathogen uses triacylglycerol (TG) as a storage form of fatty acids. Little is known about the biosynthesis of TG in               M. tuberculosis               . We show that 15 mycobacterial genes that we identified as putative triacylglycerol synthase (               tgs               ) when expressed in               Escherichia coli               showed TGS activity, and we report some basic catalytic characteristics of the most active enzymes. We show that several               tgs               genes are induced when the pathogen goes into the nonreplicative drug-resistant state caused by slow withdrawal of O               2               and also by NO treatment, which is known to induce dormancy-associated genes. The gene (Rv3130c) that shows the highest TGS activity when expressed in               E. coli               shows the highest induction by hypoxia and NO treatment. Biochemical evidence shows that TG synthesis and accumulation occur under both conditions. We conclude that TG may be a form of energy storage for use during long-term dormancy. Therefore, TG synthesis may be an appropriate target for novel antilatency drugs that can prevent the organism from surviving dormancy and thus assist in the control of tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Two billion people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb-infected macrophages are likely to be sequestered inside the hypoxic environments of the granuloma and differentiate into lipid-loaded macrophages that contain triacylglycerol (TAG)-filled lipid droplets which may provide a fatty acid-rich host environment for Mtb. We report here that human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and THP-1 derived macrophages incubated under hypoxia accumulate Oil Red O-staining lipid droplets containing TAG. Inside such hypoxic, lipid-loaded macrophages, nearly half the Mtb population developed phenotypic tolerance to isoniazid, lost acid-fast staining and accumulated intracellular lipid droplets. Dual-isotope labeling of macrophage TAG revealed that Mtb inside the lipid-loaded macrophages imports fatty acids derived from host TAG and incorporates them intact into Mtb TAG. The fatty acid composition of host and Mtb TAG were nearly identical suggesting that Mtb utilizes host TAG to accumulate intracellular TAG. Utilization of host TAG by Mtb for lipid droplet synthesis was confirmed when fluorescent fatty acid-labeled host TAG was utilized to accumulate fluorescent lipid droplets inside the pathogen. Deletion of the Mtb triacylglycerol synthase 1 (tgs1) gene resulted in a drastic decrease but not a complete loss in both radiolabeled and fluorescent TAG accumulation by Mtb suggesting that the TAG that accumulates within Mtb is generated mainly by the incorporation of fatty acids released from host TAG. We show direct evidence for the utilization of the fatty acids from host TAG for lipid metabolism inside Mtb. Taqman real-time PCR measurements revealed that the mycobacterial genes dosR, hspX, icl1, tgs1 and lipY were up-regulated in Mtb within hypoxic lipid loaded macrophages along with other Mtb genes known to be associated with dormancy and lipid metabolism.},

While there has been a significant focus on the effects of aldehydes on mammalian physiology, the idea that they might be exploited or purposefully induced to kill pathogens is new. Given that aldehydes are made as parts of metabolic programmes that accompany immune cell activation by the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) during infections, we hypothesize that aldehydes are among the arsenal of IFN-γ-inducible effectors needed for pathogen control.},

  abstract = {A 9.5-kb section of DNA called region of deletion 1 (RD1) is present in virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains but is deleted in all attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine strains. This region codes for at least nine genes. Some or all RD1 gene products may be involved in virulence and pathogenesis, and at least two, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, represent potent T- and B-cell antigens. In order to produce the entire set of RD1 proteins with their natural posttranslational modifications, a robust expression system for M. tuberculosis proteins in the fast-growing saprophytic strain Mycobacterium smegmatis was developed. Our system employs the inducible acetamidase promoter and allows translational fusion of recombinant M. tuberculosis proteins with polyhistidine or influenza hemagglutinin epitope tags for affinity purification. Using eGFP as reporter gene, we showed that the acetamidase promoter is tightly regulated in M. smegmatis and that this promoter is much stronger than the widely used constitutive groEL2 promoter. We then cloned 11 open reading frames (ORFs) found within RD1 and successfully expressed and purified the respective proteins. Sera from tuberculosis patients and M. tuberculosis-infected mice reacted with 10 purified RD1 proteins, thus demonstrating that Rv3871, Rv3872, Rv3873, CFP-10, ESAT-6, Rv3876, Rv3878, Rv3879c and ORF-14 are expressed in vivo. Finally, glycosylation of the RD1 proteins was analyzed. We present preliminary evidence that the PPE protein Rv3873 is glycosylated at its C terminus, thus highlighting the ability of M. smegmatis to produce M. tuberculosis proteins bearing posttranslational modifications. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Methods{$\quad$}Serum- and plasma-S1P from 174 healthy blood donors was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and correlated to clinical laboratory data. Selected plasma samples, 10 with high and 10 with low S1P concentrations, were fractionated into very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-, and lipoprotein-free fractions. S1P was then measured in each fraction to determine its distribution.             Results{$\quad$}The mean S1P concentration in serum (1.04\,±\,0.24\,nmol/mL) was found 39\% higher compared with plasma (0.75\,±\,0.16\,nmol/mL) and overall was not different between men and women. Only when stratified for age and gender, older women were found to exhibit higher circulatory S1P levels than men. In plasma, S1P levels correlate to red blood cell (RBC) counts but not to platelet counts. Conversely, serum-S1P correlates to platelet counts but not to RBC counts. In addition, eosinophil counts are strongly associated with serum-S1P concentrations. Both serum- and plasma-S1P correlate to total cholesterol but not to HDL-C. The distribution of S1P between VLDL-, LDL-, HDL-, and lipoprotein-free fractions is independent of total plasma-S1P concentrations. S1P concentrations in HDL but not in LDL are highly variable.             Conclusion{$\quad$}These data indicate S1P concentrations in plasma and serum to be differentially associated with cell counts and S1P carrier proteins. Besides platelets, eosinophil counts are identified as a novel determinant for serum-S1P concentrations further suggesting a role for S1P in eosinophil pathologies.},

  abstract = {Many bacterial pathogens express virulence proteins that are translocated into host cells (herein referred to as effectors), where they can interact with target proteins to manipulate host cell processes. These effector–host protein interactions are often dynamic and transient in nature, making them difficult to identify using traditional interaction-based methods. Here, we performed a systematic comparison between proximity-dependent biotin labelling (BioID) and immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate a series of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors that manipulate host intracellular trafficking (SifA, PipB2, SseF, SseG and SopD2). Using BioID, we identified 632 candidate interactions with 381 unique human proteins, collectively enriched for roles in vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton components and transport activities. From the subset of proteins exclusively identified by BioID, we report that SifA interacts with BLOC-2, a protein complex that regulates dynein motor activity. We demonstrate that the BLOC-2 complex is necessary for SifA-mediated positioning of Salmonella-containing vacuoles, and affects stability of the vacuoles during infection. Our study provides insight into the coordinated activities of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors and demonstrates the utility of BioID as a powerful, complementary tool to characterize effector–host protein interactions.},

We show that this transporter provided early microsporidians with the ability to steal host ATP and to become energy parasites. Gene duplication enabled the diversification of nucleotide transporter function to transport new substrates, including GTP and NAD+, and to evolve the proton-energized net import of nucleotides for nucleic acid biosynthesis, growth and replication. These innovations have allowed the loss of pathways for mitochondrial and cytosolic energy generation and nucleotide biosynthesis that are otherwise essential for free-living eukaryotes, resulting in the highly unusual and reduced cells and genomes of contemporary Microsporidia.},

  abstract = {Phagocytic entry of mycobacteria into macrophages requires the presence of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. This suggests that pathogenic mycobacteria may require cholesterol for their subsequent intra-cellular survival in non-maturing phagosomes. Here we report on the effect of cholesterol depletion on pre-existing phagosomes in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with Mycobacterium avium. Cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in a loosening of the close apposition between the phagosome membrane and the mycobacterial surface, followed by fusion with lysosomes. The resulting phagolysosomes then autonomously executed autophagy, which did not involve the endoplasmic reticulum. After 5 h of depletion, intact mycobacteria had accumulated in large auto-phagolysosomes. Autophagy was specific for phagolysosomes that contained mycobacteria, as it did not involve latex bead-containing phagosomes in infected cells. Upon replenishment of cholesterol, mycobacteria became increasingly aligned to the lysosomal membrane, from where they were individually sequestered in phagosomes with an all-around closely apposed phagosome membrane and which no longer fused with lysosomes. These observations indicate that, cholesterol depletion (i) resulted in phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes and (ii) caused mycobacterium-containing phagolysosomes to autonomously undergo autophagy. Furthermore, (iii) mycobacteria were not killed in autophagolysosomes, and (iv) cholesterol replenishment enabled mycobacterium to rescue itself from autophagic phagolysosomes to again reside individually in phagosomes which no longer fused with lysosomes. © 2005 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Although different studies performed at the organismal and cellular levels have helped to explain ESX-1-associated phenomena, not much is known about how ESAT-6 and CFP-10 contribute to pathogenesis at the molecular level. In this study we describe the interaction of both proteins with lipid bilayers, using biologically relevant liposomal preparations containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol. Using floatation gradient centrifugation, we demonstrate that ESAT-6 showed strong association with liposomes, and in particular with preparations containing DMPC and cholesterol, whereas the interaction of CFP-10 with membranes appeared to be weaker and less specific. Most importantly, binding to the biomembranes no longer occurred when the proteins were present as a 1:1 ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex. However, lowering of the pH resulted in dissociation of the protein complex and subsequent protein-liposome interaction. Finally, cryoelectron microscopy revealed that ESAT-6 destabilized and lysed liposomes, whereas CFP-10 did not. In conclusion, we propose that one of the main features of ESAT-6 in the infection process of               M. tuberculosis               is the interaction with biomembranes that occurs after dissociation from its putative chaperone CFP-10 under acidic conditions typically encountered in the phagosome.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the world. The current treatment is based on a combination of antimicrobials administered for six months. It is essential to find therapeutic agents with which the treatment time can be shortened and strengthen the host immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis needs cholesterol to infect and survive inside the host, but the progression of the infection depends to a large extent on the capacity of the immune response to contain the infection. Statins inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol and have pleiotropic effects on the immune system, which have been associated with better results in the treatment of several infectious diseases. Recently, it has been reported that cells treated with statins are more resistant to M. tuberculosis infection, and they have even been proposed as adjuvants in the treatment of M. tuberculosis infection. The aim of this review is to summarize the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis and its mechanisms of evasion and to compile the available scientific information on the effect of statins in the treatment of tuberculosis.},

In contrast, we show that in mice, a shed form of MULT1, a high-affinity NKG2D ligand, causes NK cell activation and tumor rejection. Recombinant soluble MULT1 stimulated tumor rejection in mice. Soluble MULT1 functions, at least in part, by competitively reversing a global desensitization of NK cells imposed by engagement of membrane NKG2D ligands on tumor-associated cells, such as myeloid cells. The results overturn conventional wisdom that soluble ligands are always inhibitory and suggest a new approach for cancer immunotherapy.},

Supplementary key words fiber • lipidomics • transcriptomics Soluble fibers such as inulin-type fructans are natural components of several edible fruits and vegetables, and the average individual daily consumption has been estimated to be between 1 and 11 g in Europe and the United States (1, 2). A very recent meta-analysis found that people consuming high levels of dietary fiber have a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and incidence of common non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, than those eating less fiber (3). Dietary supplementation with inulin-type fructans has been associated with the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk in clinical trials (4, 5). Accumulating evidence has revealed that dietary inulin can modulate gut microbiota composition and generate short-chain FAs, which are associated with beneficial effects on host lipid metabolism, such as decreased circulating cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels (6-8). However, the effects of inulin on systemic lipid metabolism remain to be investigated. Identification of these mechanisms might lead to improved approaches for dietary interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Abstract Elevated circulating levels of ceramides (Cers) are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, and Cers may play a causative role in metabolic dysfunction that precedes cardiac events, such as mortality as a result of coronary artery disease. Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating Cer levels could be protective against cardiovascu-lar diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on lipid metabolism with a model of athero-sclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma Cer ratio and lower levels of circulating Cers associated with VLDL and LDL. Liver transcriptomic analysis revealed that Smpd3, a gene that encodes neutral SMase (NSMase), was downregulated by 2-fold in inulin-fed mice. Hepatic NSMase activity was 3-fold lower in inulin-fed mice than in controls. Furthermore, liver redox status and compositions of phosphatidylserine and FFA species, the major factors that determine NSMase activity, were also modified by inulin. Taken together, these results showed that, in mice, inulin can decrease plasma Cer levels through reductions in NSMase expression and activity, suggesting a mechanism by which fiber could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk},

  abstract = {Significance             The biochemical reactions that drive cellular life are housed in distinct membrane enclosed compartments known as organelles. Whereas proteins targeting to different organelles are well developed, little is known regarding how lipids are sorted to different organelles. We engineered a protein from a marine organism into a fluorescent “biosensor” of sphingomyelin (SM), a sphingolipid that is produced in the Golgi apparatus but is a major component of the plasma membrane. By monitoring SM dynamics in live cells, we discovered that SM is transported from its site of synthesis in the Golgi to the plasma membrane in a distinct type of secretory transport carrier. Our findings show that vesicle-based trafficking pathways are specialized to transport distinct types of lipids, in addition to proteins.           ,                             One of the principal functions of the               trans               Golgi network (TGN) is the sorting of proteins into distinct vesicular transport carriers that mediate secretion and interorganelle trafficking. Are lipids also sorted into distinct TGN-derived carriers? The Golgi is the principal site of the synthesis of sphingomyelin (SM), an abundant sphingolipid that is transported. To address the specificity of SM transport to the plasma membrane, we engineered a natural SM-binding pore-forming toxin, equinatoxin II (Eqt), into a nontoxic reporter termed Eqt-SM and used it to monitor intracellular trafficking of SM. Using quantitative live cell imaging, we found that Eqt-SM is enriched in a subset of TGN-derived secretory vesicles that are also enriched in a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. In contrast, an integral membrane secretory protein (CD8α) is not enriched in these carriers. Our results demonstrate the sorting of native SM at the TGN and its transport to the plasma membrane by specific carriers.},

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunocytochemistry, and biochemical assays have been used to characterize the composition of LBC at different time points after their formation, as well as their interactions with the organelles of the endocytic pathway. Our results show that LBC acquire and lose various markers during their transformation into phagolysosomes. Among these are members of the rab family of small GTPases as well as proteins of the lamp family. The transfer of the LBC of lamp 2, a membrane protein associated with late endocytic structures, was shown to be microtubule dependent. Video-microscopy showed that newly formed phagosomes were involved in rapid multiple contacts with late components of the endocytic pathway. Collectively, these observations suggest that phagolysosome formation is a highly dynamic process that involves the gradual and regulated acquisition of markers from endocytic organelles.},

The machinery required by phagosomes to mediate these interactions is poorly understood. In this study, we allowed human and various rodent cells to take up latex beads whose density facilitates a simple purification of phagosomes using discontinuous sucrose gradients. With this system, we initiated a systematic study of phagosome proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the currently available two-dimensional gel protein data bases. By this approach, we were able to recognize a group of polypeptides associated with mouse J774 phagosomes-phagolysosomes including annexin II, annexin VI, the beta-1 and beta-2 subunits of trimeric G proteins, and a group of actin-binding proteins. While the amount of annexin II associated to phagosomes was similar at all times of latex internalization, the levels of annexin VI were higher on late phagosomes. Phospholipid analysis of J774 phagosomes isolated at early and late time points during phagolysosome formation also revealed significant differences in their lipid composition. In the human phagosomes, we resolved over 200 polypeptides on the two-dimensional gels. These included the proteins described in the mouse, as well as 32 polypeptides that were found to be highly enriched in phagosomes, 15 of which are not present in the current data bases. The results demonstrate that the use of latex bead phagosomes is a powerful system to identify key molecules involved in phagolysosome biogenesis.},

  abstract = {The assembly of the Yersinia enterocolitica type III secretion injectisome was investigated by grafting fluorescent proteins onto several components, YscC (outer-membrane (OM) ring), YscD (forms the inner-membrane (IM) ring together with YscJ), YscN (ATPase), and YscQ (putative C ring). The recombinant injectisomes were functional and appeared as fluorescent spots at the cell periphery. Epistasis experiments with the hybrid alleles in an array of injectisome mutants revealed a novel outside-in assembly order: whereas YscC formed spots in the absence of any other structural protein, formation of YscD foci required YscC, but not YscJ. We therefore propose that the assembly starts with YscC and proceeds through the connector YscD to YscJ, which was further corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Completion of the membrane rings allowed the subsequent assembly of cytosolic components. YscN and YscQ attached synchronously, requiring each other, the interacting proteins YscK and YscL, but no further injectisome component for their assembly. These results show that assembly is initiated by the formation of the OM ring and progresses inwards to the IM ring and, finally, to a large cytosolic complex.},

We investigated whether the virus can replicate on pseudostratified human airway epithelium. This cell culture system mimics the human airway environment and facilitates culturing of various respiratory agents. The cells were inoculated with human bocavirus-positive nasopharyngeal washes from children, and virus replication was monitored by measuring apical release of the virus via real-time PCR. Furthermore, we identified different viral mRNAs in the infected cells. All mRNAs were transcribed from a single promoter but varied due to alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, similar to what has been described for bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, the other two members of the Bocavirus genus. Thus, transcription of human bocavirus displays strong homology to the transcription of the other bocaviruses. In conclusion, we report here for the first time that human bocavirus can be propagated in an in vitro culture system and present a detailed map of the set of mRNAs that are produced by the virus},

  abstract = {The human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry port of many human respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Nowadays, four HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63, are known to be circulating worldwide, causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections in nonhospitalized and hospitalized children. Studies of the fundamental aspects of these HCoV infections at the primary entry port, such as cell tropism, are seriously hampered by the lack of a universal culture system or suitable animal models. To expand the knowledge on fundamental virus-host interactions for all four HCoVs at the site of primary infection, we used pseudostratified HAE cell cultures to isolate and characterize representative clinical HCoV strains directly from nasopharyngeal material. Ten contemporary isolates were obtained, representing HCoV- 229E (n=1), HCoV-NL63 (n=1), HCoV-HKU1 (n=4), and HCoV-OC43 (n=4). For each strain, we analyzed the replication kinetics and progeny virus release on HAE cell cultures derived from different donors. Surprisingly, by visualizing HCoV infection by confocal microscopy, we observed that HCoV-229E employs a target cell tropism for nonciliated cells, whereas HCoVOC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 all infect ciliated cells. Collectively, the data demonstrate that HAE cell cultures, which morphologically and functionally resemble human airways in vivo, represent a robust universal culture system for isolating and comparing all contemporary HCoV strains. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

Chem. 260, 15311-15317). In this study, the endosomal protease is identified as cathepsin D by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies raised against rabbit cathepsin D and by NH2-terminal sequence. In order to elucidate the mechanism for targeting of cathepsin D to endosomes, we first examined the membrane association of cathepsin D with light (rho = 1.05 g/ml) and heavy density (rho = 1.1 g/ml) vesicles from Percoll density gradients. After sequential washes, 8.4 and 21.9\% of cathepsin D activity remained associated with heavy and light density vesicles, respectively. This membrane-associated cathepsin D could not be solubilized in either buffer at pH 5.0 containing mannose 6-phosphate and EDTA or in buffer at pH 10.6. Solubilization required the detergent Triton X-100. To determine whether membrane-associated cathepsin D was found in endosomes, the enzyme was radioiodinated within endosomes and lysosomes with internalized lactoperoxidase. The membrane-associated form was detected in endosomes, but much less in lysosomes. Biosynthetic studies combined with the same extraction procedure revealed that macrophage cathepsin D is first synthesized as an inactive membrane-associated precursor. The precursor is processed to an active, membrane-associated form and then to the active soluble form found in lysosomes. Our studies provide evidence that 1) cathepsin D is in endosomes of macrophages; 2) cathepsin D is transported to endosomes as a membrane-associated form; and 3) the membrane-associated form is a biosynthetic precursor for the soluble form found in endosomes and lysosomes.},

Although the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is an important experimental variable, the selection of MOI in mycobacterial infection experiments is largely empirical, without reference to solid experimental data.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Macrophage (MΦ) infection models are important tools for studying host–mycobacterial interactions. Although the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is an important experimental variable, the selection of MOI in mycobacterial infection experiments is largely empirical, without reference to solid experimental data. To provide relevant data, we used RNA-seq to analyze the gene expression profiles of MΦs 4 or 24\,h after infection with               Mycobacterium marinum               (               M. m               ) at MOIs ranging from 0.1 to 50. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that different MOIs are linked to distinct transcriptomic changes and only 10\% of DEGs were shared by MΦ infected at all MOIs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that type I interferon (IFN)-related pathways were inoculant dose-dependent and enriched only at high MOIs, whereas TNF pathways were inoculant dose-independent and enriched at all MOIs. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network alignment showed that different MOIs had distinct key node genes. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting and follow-up RT-PCR analysis, we could separate infected MΦs from uninfected MΦs and found phagocytosis of mycobacteria to be the determinant factor for type I IFN production. The distinct transcriptional regulation of RAW264.7 MΦ genes at different MOIs was also seen with               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (               M.tb               ) infections and primary MΦ infection models. In summary, transcriptional profiling of mycobacterial infected MΦs revealed that different MOIs activate distinct immune pathways and the type I IFN pathway is activated only at high MOIs. This study should provide guidance for selecting the MOI most appropriate for different research questions.},

In the course of studying the potential impact of HARN on the pleura we have utilised the existing hypothesis regarding the role of the parietal pleura in the response to long fibres. This review seeks to synthesise our new data with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) with that hypothesis for the behaviour of long fibres in the lung and their retention in the parietal pleura leading to the initiation of inflammation and pleural pathology such as mesothelioma. We describe evidence that a fraction of all deposited particles reach the pleura and that a mechanism of particle clearance from the pleura exits, through stomata in the parietal pleura. We suggest that these stomata are the site of retention of long fibres which cannot negotiate them leading to inflammation and pleural pathology including mesothelioma. We cite thoracoscopic data to support the contention, as would be anticipated from the preceding, that the parietal pleura is the site of origin of pleural mesothelioma. This mechanism, if it finds support, has important implications for future research into the mesothelioma hazard from HARN and also for our current view of the origins of asbestos-initiated pleural mesothelioma and the common use of lung parenchymal asbestos fibre burden as a correlate of this tumour, which actually arises in the parietal pleura.}

The present study was designed to elucidate the role of membrane SM in vivo and in vitro using sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) knock out (SMS1 -/-) mice and Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis. After establishing SMS1 -/- mice, we investigated CD4+ T-cell functions including proliferation, cytokine production and signal transduction in vivo. We also examined severity of hepatitis, cytokine production in serum and liver after ConA injection at a dose of 20 mg kg -1. CD4+ T cells from SMS1 -/- mice showed severe deficiency of membrane SM and several profound defects compared with wild-type controls as follows: (i) cellular proliferation and production of IL-2 and IFN-γ by co-cross-linking of CD3 and CD4; (ii) tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and its association with ZAP-70; (iii) clustering and co-localization of TCR with lipid rafts. Consistent with these impaired CD4+ T-cell functions in vitro, SMS1 -/- mice showed decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ by ConA injection, which renders SMS1 -/- mice less sensitive to ConA-induced hepatitis. These results indicated that the deficiency of membrane SM caused the CD4+ T-cell dysfunction through impaired lipid raft function contributed to protection of ConA-induced liver injury, suggesting that the membrane SM is critical for full T-cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2012.

The remains are those of a woman, Irtyersenu, aged about 50, from the necropolis of Thebes and dated to about 600 BC. Augustus Bozzi Granville (1783-1872), an eminent physician and obstetrician, described many organs still in situ and attributed the cause of death to a tumour of the ovary. However, subsequent histological investigations indicate that the tumour is a benign cystadenoma. Histology of the lungs demonstrated a potentially fatal pulmonary exudate and earlier studies attempted to associate this with particular disease conditions. Palaeopathology and ancient DNA analyses show that tuberculosis was widespread in ancient Egypt, so a systematic search for tuberculosis was made, using specific DNA and lipid biomarker analyses. Clear evidence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA was obtained in lung tissue and gall bladder samples, based on nested PCR of the IS6110 locus. Lung and femurs were positive for specific M. tuberculosis complex cell-wall mycolic acids, demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography of pyrenebutyric acid-pentafluorobenzyl mycolates. Therefore, tuberculosis is likely to have been the major cause of death of Irtyersenu.},

We show MTP RNA and protein in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and by immunoblotting of mouse liver mononuclear cells and mouse and human B cell lines. Functional MTP, demonstrated by specific triglyceride transfer activity, is present in both mouse splenocytes and a CD1d-positive mouse NKT hybridoma. In a novel in vitro transfer assay, purified MTP directly transfers phospholipids, but not triglycerides, to recombinant CD1d. Chemical inhibition of MTP lipid transfer does not affect major histocompatibility complex class II presentation of ovalbumin, but considerably reduces CD1d-mediated presentation of α-galactosylceramide (α-galcer) and endogenous antigens in mouse splenic and bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs), as well as in human APC lines and monocyte-derived DCs. Silencing MTP expression in the human monocyte line U937 affects CD1d function, as shown by diminished presentation of α-galcer. We propose that MTP acts upstream of the saposins and functions as an ER chaperone by loading endogenous lipids onto nascent CD1d. Furthermore, our studies suggest that a small molecule inhibitor could be used to modulate the activity of NKT cells.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and phagocytosis are hallmarks of macrophage-mediated innate immune responses to bacterial infection. However, the relationship between these two processes is not well established. Our data indicate that TLK ligands specifically promote bacterial phagocytosis, in both murine and human cells, through induction of a phagocytic gene program. Importantly, TLR-induced phagocytosis of bacteria was found to be reliant on myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent signaling through interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 and p38 leading to the up-regulation of scavenger receptors. Interestingly, individual TLRs promote phagocytosis to varying degrees with TLR9 being the strongest and TLR3 being the weakest inducer of this process. We also demonstrate that TLR ligands not only amplify the percentage of phagocytes uptaking Escherichia coli, but also increase the number of bacteria phagocytosed by individual macrophages. Taken together, our data describe an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which TLRs can specifically promote phagocytic clearance of bacteria during infection.},

  abstract = {The perforation of the plasmalemma by pore-forming toxins causes an influx of Ca2+ and an efflux of cytoplasmic proteins. In order to ensure cellular survival, lesions have to be identified, plugged and removed from the membrane. The Ca2+-driven fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane leads to hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by acid sphingomyelinase and a formation of ceramide platforms in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. We propose that the negative curvature, promoted by tighter packing of lipids in the outer layer, leads to an inward vesiculation of the damaged area for its endocytotic uptake and internal degradation. In contrast, the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase triggers the production of ceramide within the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, thereby promoting an outward curvature, which enables the cell to shed the membrane-containing toxin pore into the extracellular space. In this process, ceramide is supported by members of the annexin protein family which act as Ca2+ sensors and as membrane fusion agents.}

  abstract = {Influenza virus is an RNA virus encapsulated in a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell plasma membrane. Previous studies showed that influenza virus infection depends on cellular lipids, including the sphingolipids sphingomyelin and sphingosine. Here we examined the role of a third sphingolipid, glucosylceramide, in influenza virus infection following clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9)-mediated knockout (KO) of its metabolizing enzyme glucosylceramidase (GBA). After confirming GBA knockout of HEK 293 and A549 cells by both Western blotting and lipid mass spectrometry, we observed diminished infection in both KO cell lines by a PR8 (H1N1) green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter virus. We further showed that the reduction in infection correlated with impaired influenza virus trafficking to late endosomes and hence with fusion and entry. To examine whether GBA is required for other enveloped viruses, we compared the results seen with entry mediated by the glycoproteins of Ebola virus, influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and measles virus in GBA knockout cells. Entry inhibition was relatively robust for Ebola virus and influenza virus, modest for VSV, and mild for measles virus, suggesting a greater role for viruses that enter cells by fusing with late endosomes. As the virus studies suggested a general role for GBA along the endocytic pathway, we tested that hypothesis and found that trafficking of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to late endosomes and degradation of its receptor were impaired in GBA knockout cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that GBA is critically important for endocytic trafficking of viruses as well as of cellular cargos, including growth factor receptors. Modulation of glucosylceramide levels may therefore represent a novel accompaniment to strategies to antagonize “late-penetrating” viruses, including influenza virus.},

RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified for systematic review. Studies were conducted in six different countries. Overall, prevalence of MDR TB among prisoners varied greatly between studies. Our findings suggest a high prevalence of MDR TB in prisons of Post-Soviet states with percentages as high as 16 times more than the worldwide prevalence estimated by the WHO in 2014. CONCLUSION: All studies suggested a high prevalence of MDR TB in prison populations in Post-Soviet states.},

The conversion of ceramide into sphingosine is mediated by ceramidases. Altogether, five human ceramidases—named acid ceramidase, neutral ceramidase, alkaline ceramidase 1, alkaline ceramidase 2, and alkaline ceramidase 3—have been identified as having maximal activities in acidic, neutral, and alkaline environments, respectively. All five ceramidases have received increased attention for their implications in various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Farber disease. Furthermore, the potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of ceramidases in host cells exposed to pathogenic bacteria and viruses have also been demonstrated. While ceramidases have been a subject of study in recent decades, our knowledge of their pathophysiology remains limited. Thus, this review provides a critical evaluation and interpretive analysis of existing literature on the role of acid, neutral, and alkaline ceramidases in relation to human health and various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases. In addition, the essential impact of ceramidases on tissue regeneration, as well as their usefulness in enzyme replacement therapy, is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Human genetic control is thought to affect a considerable part of the outcome of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Most of us deal with the pathogen by containment (associated with clinical “latency”) or sterilization, but tragically millions each year do not. After decades of studies on host genetic susceptibility to Mtb infection, genetic variation has been discovered to play a role in tuberculous immunoreactivity and tuberculosis (TB) disease. Genes encoding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) enable a consistent, molecularly direct interaction between humans and Mtb which suggests the potential for co-evolution. In this review, we explore the roles ascribed to PRRs during Mtb infection and ask whether such a longstanding and intimate interface between our immune system and this pathogen plays a critical role in determining the outcome of Mtb infection. The scientific evidence to date suggests that PRR variation is clearly implicated in altered immunity to Mtb but has a more subtle role in limiting the pathogen and pathogenesis. In contrast to ‘effectors’ like IFN-γ, IL-12, Nitric Oxide and TNF that are critical for Mtb control, ‘sensors’ like PRRs are less critical for the outcome of Mtb infection. This is potentially due to redundancy of the numerous PRRs in the innate arsenal, such that Mtb rarely goes unnoticed. Genetic association studies investigating PRRs during Mtb infection should therefore be designed to investigate endophenotypes of infection – such as immunological or clinical variation – rather than just TB disease, if we hope to understand the molecular interface between innate immunity and Mtb.},

Previous studies have shown that T. gondii could interfere with host NF-κB signaling to promote their survival, but the effectors of type I strains remain unclear. The polymorphic rhoptry protein ROP18 is a key serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates host proteins to modulate acute virulence. Our data demonstrated that the N-terminal portion of ROP18 is associated with the dimerization domain of p65. ROP18 phosphorylates p65 at Ser-468 and targets this protein to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. The kinase activity of ROP18 is required for p65 degradation and suppresses NF-κB activation. Consistently, compared with wild-type ROP18 strain, ROP18 kinase-deficient type I parasites displayed a severe inability to inhibit NF-κB, culminating in the enhanced production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α in infected macrophages. In addition, studies have shown that transgenic parasites carrying kinase-deficient ROP18 induce M1-biased activation. These results demonstrate for the first time that the virulence factor ROP18 in T. gondii type I strains is responsible for inhibiting the host NF-κB pathway and for suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression, thus providing a survival advantage to the infectious agent.},

Recent attention has focused on host-directed therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), as adjunctive treatment given with antitubercular drugs. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have broad anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.In the current study, we screened 8 commercially available statins for cytotoxic effect, anti-TB activity, synergy with first-line drugs in macrophages, pharmacokinetics and adjunctive bactericidal activity, and, in 2 different mouse models, as adjunctive therapy to first-line TB drugs.Pravastatin showed the least toxicity in THP-1 and Vero cells. At nontoxic doses, atorvastatin and mevastatin were unable to inhibit Mtb growth in THP-1 cells. Simvastatin, fluvastatin, and pravastatin showed the most favorable therapeutic index and enhanced the antitubercular activity of the first-line drugs isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in THP-1 cells. Pravastatin modulated phagosomal maturation characteristics in macrophages, phenocopying macrophage activation, and exhibited potent adjunctive activity in the standard mouse model of TB chemotherapy and in a mouse model of human-like necrotic TB lung granulomas.These data provide compelling evidence for clinical evaluation of pravastatin as adjunctive, host-directed therapy for TB.},

Here we demonstrate that this maturation process involves the GTPase Rab7. Rab7 recruitment to phagosomes was found to precede and to be essential for their fusion with late endosomes and/or lysosomes. Active Rab7 on the phagosomal membrane associates with the effector protein RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein), which in turn bridges phagosomes with dynein-dynactin, a microtubule-associated motor complex. The motors not only displace phagosomes in the centripetal direction but, strikingly, promote the extension of phagosomal tubules toward late endocytic compartments. Fusion of tubules with these organelles was documented by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tubule extension and fusion with late endosomes and/or lysosomes were prevented by expression of a truncated form of RILP lacking the dynein-dynactin-recruiting domain. We conclude that full maturation of phagosomes requires the retrograde emission of tubular extensions, which are generated by activation of Rab7, recruitment of RILP, and consequent association of phagosomes with microtubule-associated motors.},

  abstract = {A granuloma is defined as an inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate that, while capable of limiting growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also provides a survival niche from which the bacteria may disseminate. The tuberculosis lesion is highly dynamic and shaped by both, immune response elements and the pathogen. In the granuloma, M. tuberculosis switches to a non-replicating but energy-generating life style whose detailed molecular characterization can identify novel targets for chemotherapy. To secure transmission to a new host, M. tuberculosis has evolved to drive T cell immunity to the point that necro-tizing granulomas leak into bronchial cavities to facilitate expectoration of bacilli. From an evolutionary perspective it is therefore questionable whether vaccination and immunity enhancing strategies that merely mimic the natural immune response directed against M. tuberculosis infection can overcome pulmonary tuberculosis in the adult population. Juxtaposition of molecular pathology and immunology with microbial physiology and the use of novel imaging approaches afford an integrative view of the granuloma's contribution to the life cycle of M. tuberculosis. This review revisits the different input of innate and adaptive immunity in granuloma biogenesis, with a focus on the co-evolutionary forces that redirect immune responses also to the benefit of the pathogen, i.e., its survival, propagation, and transmission. © 2013 Ehlers and Schaible.},

  abstract = {Proteins and lipids of the plasma membrane underlie constant remodeling via a combination of the secretory- and the endocytic pathway. In the yeast endocytic pathway, cargo is sorted for recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation in vacuoles. Previously we have shown a role for the GARP complex in sphingolipid sorting and homeostasis (Fröhlich et al. 2015). However, the majority of cargo sorted in a GARP dependent process remain largely unknown. Here we use auxin induced degradation of GARP combined with mass spectrometry based vacuolar proteomics and lipidomics to show that recycling of two specific groups of proteins, the amino-phospholipid flippases and cell wall synthesis proteins depends on a functional GARP complex. Our results suggest that mis-sorting of flippases and remodeling of the lipid composition are the first occurring defects in GARP mutants. Our assay can be adapted to systematically map cargo of the entire endocytic pathway.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important family of receptors that constitute the first line of defense system against microbes. They can recognize both invading pathogens and endogenous danger molecules released from dying cells and damaged tissues and play a key role in linking innate and adaptive immunity. TLRs are widely distributed in both immune and other body cells. The expressions and locations of TLRs are regulated in response to specific molecules derived from pathogens or damaged host cells. The binding of ligands to TLR activates specific intracellular signaling cascades that initiate host defense reactions. Such binding is ligand-dependent and cell type-dependent and leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon. TLR-dependent signaling pathways are tightly increased during innate immune responses by a variety of negative regulators. Overactivation of TLRs can ultimately lead to disruption of immune homeostasis and thus increase the risk for inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders. Antagonists/inhibitors targeting the TLR signaling pathways have emerged as novel therapeutics to treat these diseases.                                         Aim of work               The present review summarizes the structure, characterizations, and signaling of TLRs and their regulators, as well as describes the implication of TLRs in many diseases with a brief idea about the inhibitors that target TLR signaling pathways.                                         Conclusion               We conclude that TLRs are the main elements of our immune system, and they should be maintained functioning to keep the integrity of innate immunity. Targeting of TLR signaling represents a new challenge for treatment of many diseases.},

It involves the recruitment of many cell types and the production of various inflammatory mediators in attempts to contain and reverse the insult. However, inflammation can lead to irreversible tissue destruction by itself and, therefore, can represent a disease state that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the inflammatory response is essential to formulate therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. In fact, substantial research has unveiled important aspects of the inflammatory machinery, both at the cellular and molecular levels. Recently, sphingolipids (SLs) have emerged as signaling molecules that regulate many cell functions, and ample evidence emphasizes their role in the regulation of inflammatory responses.

  abstract = {Pathogenic bacteria enter the cytosol of host cells through uptake into bacteria-containing vacuoles (BCVs) and subsequent rupture of the vacuolar membrane [1]. Bacterial invaders are sensed either directly, through cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors specific for bacterial ligands, or indirectly, through danger receptors that bind host molecules displayed in an abnormal context, for example, glycans on damaged BCVs [2–4]. In contrast to damage caused by Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium, BCV rupture by Gram-negative pathogens such as Shigella flexneri or Salmonella Typhimurium remains incompletely understood [5, 6]. The latter may cause membrane damage directly, when inserting their Type Three Secretion needles into host membranes, or indirectly through translocated bacterial effector proteins [7–9]. Here, we report that sphingomyelin, an abundant lipid of the luminal leaflet of BCV membranes, and normally absent from the cytosol, becomes exposed to the cytosol as an early predictive marker of BCV rupture by Gram-negative bacteria. To monitor subcellular sphingomyelin distribution, we generated a live sphingomyelin reporter from Lysenin, a sphingomyelin-specific toxin from the earthworm Eisenia fetida [10, 11]. Using super resolution live imaging and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we discovered that BCV rupture proceeds through two distinct successive stages: first, sphingomyelin is gradually translocated into the cytosolic leaflet of the BCV, invariably followed by cytosolic exposure of glycans, which recruit galectin-8, indicating bacterial entry into the cytosol. Exposure of sphingomyelin on BCVs may therefore act as an early danger signal alerting the cell to imminent bacterial invasion.},

  abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

However, there is substantial evidence that self-clearance of Mtb infection can occur. We infer a curve of self-clearance by time since infection and explore its implications for TB epidemiology. Methods and findings: data for self-clearance were inferred using post-mortem and tuberculin-skin-test reversion studies. A cohort model allowing for self-clearance was fitted in a Bayesian framework before estimating the lifetime risk of TB disease and the population infected with Mtb in India, China and Japan in 2019. We estimated that 24.4\% (17.8-32.6\%, 95\% uncertainty interval (UI)) of individuals self-clear within 10 years of infection, and 73.1\% (64.6-81.7\%) over a lifetime. The lifetime risk of TB disease was 17.0\% (10.9-22.5\%), compared to 12.6\% (10.1-15.0\%) assuming lifelong infection. The population at risk of TB disease in India, China and Japan was 35-80\% (95\% UI) smaller in the self-clearance scenario. Conclusions: the population with a viable Mtb infection may be markedly smaller than generally assumed, with such individuals at greater risk of TB disease. The ability to identify these individuals could dramatically improve the targeting of preventive programmes and inform TB vaccine development, bringing TB elimination within reach of feasibility.},

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin and cholesterol are essential lipids that are enriched in plasma membranes of animal cells, where they interact to regulate membrane properties and many intracellular signaling processes. Despite intense study, the interaction between these lipids in membranes is not well understood. Here, structural and biochemical analyses of ostreolysin A (OlyA), a protein that binds to membranes only when they contain both sphingomyelin and cholesterol, reveal that sphingomyelin adopts two distinct conformations in membranes when cholesterol is present. One conformation, bound by OlyA, is induced by stoichiometric, exothermic interactions with cholesterol, properties that are consistent with sphingomyelin/cholesterol complexes. In its second conformation, sphingomyelin is free from cholesterol and does not bind OlyA. A point mutation abolishes OlyA's ability to discriminate between these two conformations. In cells, levels of sphingomyelin/cholesterol complexes are held constant over a wide range of plasma membrane cholesterol concentrations, enabling precise regulation of the chemical activity of cholesterol. The plasma membrane lipid sphingomyelin has two distinct conformations depending on the presence or absence of cholesterol.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Lysosomes are central organelles for cellular degradation and energy homeostasis. In addition, lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and subsequent release of lysosomal content to the cytosol can initiate programmed cell death. The extent of LMP and available repair mechanisms determine the cell fate after lysosomal damage. In this study, we aimed to investigate the premises for lysosomal membrane repair after LMP and found that lysosomal membrane damage initiated by               l               -leucyl-               l               -leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in almost 50\% of the cells, while the rest recovered. Immediately after LLOMe addition, lysosomal proteases were detected in the cytosol and the ESCRT-components ALIX and CHMP4B were recruited to the lysosomal membrane. Next, lysophagic clearance of damaged lysosomes was evident and a concentration-dependent translocation of several lysosomal membrane proteins, including LAMP2, to the cytosol was found. LAMP2 was present in small vesicles with the N-terminal protein chain facing the lumen of the vesicle. We conclude that lysophagic clearance of damaged lysosomes results in generation of lysosomal membrane protein complexes, which constitute small membrane enclosed units, possibly for recycling of lysosomal membrane proteins. These lysosomal membrane complexes enable an efficient regeneration of lysosomes to regain cell functionality.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded by the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) is critical for the virulence of this organism. Existing studies suggest that the complete repertoire of T6SS effectors delivered to host cells is encoded by the FPI. Using a proteome-wide approach, we discovered that the FPI-encoded T6SS exports at least three effectors encoded outside of the island. These proteins share features with virulence determinants of other pathogens, and we provide evidence that they can contribute to intramacrophage growth. The remaining proteins that we identified are encoded within the FPI. Two of these FPI-encoded proteins constitute effectors, whereas the others form a unique complex required for core function of the T6SS apparatus. The discovery of secreted effectors mediating interactions between Francisella and its host significantly advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of this organism.},

In the present study, the impact of wild type or mutated region of difference 1 (RD1) variants on the immunogenicity of Mtb and BCG recombinants was investigated in human primary dendritic cells (DC). A comparative analysis of transcriptome, signalling pathway activation, maturation, apoptosis, cytokine production and capacity to promote Th1 responses demonstrated that DC sense quantitative and qualitative differences in the expression of RD1-encoded factors - ESAT6 and CFP10 - within BCG or Mtb backgrounds. Expansion of IFN-γ producing T cells was promoted by BCG::RD1-challenged DC, as compared to their BCG-infected counterparts. Although Mtb recombinants acted as a strong Th-1 promoting stimulus, even with RD1 deletion, the attenuated Mtb strain carrying a C-terminus truncated ESAT-6 elicited a robust Th1 promoting phenotype in DC. Collectively, these studies indicate a necessary but not sufficient role for the RD1 locus in promoting DC immune-regulatory functions. Additional mycobacterial factors are likely required to endow DC with a high Th1 polarizing capacity, a desirable attribute for a successful control of Mtb infection.},

A better understanding of the viral life cycle, including the mechanisms of entry into host cells, is needed to identify novel therapeutic targets. Although HCV entry requires the CD81 co-receptor, and other host molecules have been implicated, at least one factor critical to this process remains unknown (reviewed in refs 1-3). Using an iterative expression cloning approach we identified claudin-1 (CLDN1), a tight junction component that is highly expressed in the liver, as essential for HCV entry. CLDN1 is required for HCV infection of human hepatoma cell lines and is the first factor to confer susceptibility to HCV when ectopically expressed in non-hepatic cells. Discrete residues within the first extracellular loop (EL1) of CLDN1, but not protein interaction motifs in intracellular domains, are critical for HCV entry. Moreover, antibodies directed against an epitope inserted in the CLDN1 EL1 block HCV infection. The kinetics of this inhibition indicate that CLDN1 acts late in the entry process, after virus binding and interaction with the HCV co-receptor CD81. With CLDN1 we have identified a novel key factor for HCV entry and a new target for antiviral drug development.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Depletion of dendritic cells (DCs) via apoptosis contributes to sepsis-induced immune suppression. The mechanisms leading to DC apoptosis during sepsis are not known. In this study we report that immature DCs undergo apoptosis when treated with high numbers of Escherichia coli. This effect was mimicked by high concentrations of LPS. Apoptosis was accompanied by generation of ceramide through activation of acid sphingomyelinase (A-SMase), was prevented by inhibitors of this enzyme, and was restored by exogenous ceramide. Compared with immature DCs, mature DCs expressed significantly reduced levels of A-SMase, did not generate ceramide in response to E. coli or LPS, and were insensitive to E. coli- and LPS-triggered apoptosis. However, sensitivity to apoptosis was restored by addition of exogenous A-SMase or ceramide. Furthermore, inhibition of A-SMase activation and ceramide generation was found to be the mechanism through which the immune-modulating messenger NO protects immature DCs from the apoptogenic effects of E. coli and LPS. NO acted through formation of cGMP and stimulation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The relevance of A-SMase and its inhibition by NO/cGMP were confirmed in a mouse model of LPS-induced sepsis. DC apoptosis was significantly higher in inducible NO synthase-deficient mice than in wild-type animals and was significantly reduced by treatment ex vivo with NO, cGMP, or the A-SMase inhibitor imipramine. Thus, A-SMase plays a central role in E. coli/LPS-induced DC apoptosis and its inhibition by NO, and it might be a target of new therapeutic approaches to sepsis.},

TLR2 has been reported to participate in the recognition of Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus). However, the role of TLR2 in phagocytosis and autophagy in S. aureus-stimulated macrophages and the underlying mechanisms as yet remain unclear. In the present study, stimulation of mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with S. aureus activated multiple signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Rac1 and triggered autophagy process. Knockdown of TLR2 by siRNA significantly reduced phagocytosis and autophagy of macrophages upon S. aureus infection. Interestingly, TLR2 siRNA markedly attenuated S. aureus-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 or extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) in macrophages. Similarly, SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, also down-regulated phagocytosis and autophagy in S. aureus-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, TLR2 siRNA and SP600125 simultaneous treatment showed similar phagocytosis and autophagy compared to that in TLR2 siRNA treatment alone. Collectively, our results indicate that TLR2 may be critical for phagocytosis and autophagy through JNK signaling pathway, and provide an underlying mechanistic link between innate immune receptor and induction of phagocytosis and autophagy in S. aureus-stimulated macrophages. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we map alterations in host lipids following SARS-CoV-2 infection using nontargeted lipidomics. We find that SARS-CoV-2 rewires host lipid metabolism, significantly altering hundreds of lipid species to effectively establish infection. We correlate these changes with viral protein activity by transfecting human cells with each viral protein and performing lipidomics. We find that lipid droplet plasticity is a key feature of infection and that viral propagation can be blocked by small-molecule glycerolipid biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this inhibition was effective against the main variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), indicating that glycerolipid biosynthesis is a conserved host dependency factor that supports this evolving virus.},

  abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is an essential and responsive cellular mechanism that directly affects cell growth and proliferation, and its potential to address metabolic challenge is incompletely defined. Ceramide is an antiproliferative sphingolipid found within vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The hypothesis that ceramide inhibits cell growth through nuclear transport regulation was tested. In smooth muscle cells, exogenously supplemented ceramide inhibited classical nuclear protein import that involved the activation of cytosolic p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). After application of SB 202190, a specific and potent pharmacological antagonist of p38 MAPK, sphingolipid impingement on nuclear transport was corrected. Distribution pattern assessments of two essential nuclear transport proteins, importin-a and Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility, revealed ceramide-mediated relocalization that was reversed upon the addition of SB 202190. Furthermore, cell counts, nuclear cyclin A, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, markers of cellular proliferation, were diminished after ceramide treatment and effectively rescued by the addition of inhibitor. Together, these data demonstrate, for the first time, the sphingolipid regulation of nuclear import that defines and expands the adaptive capacity of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery.

  abstract = {Abstract Mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens that can survive within macrophage phagosomes, thereby evading host defense strategies by largely unknown mechanisms. We have identified a WD repeat host protein that was recruited to and actively retained on phagosomes by living, but not dead, mycobacteria. This protein, termed TACO, represents a component of the phagosome coat that is normally released prior to phagosome fusion with or maturation into lysosomes. In macrophages lacking TACO, mycobacteria were readily transported to lysosomes followed by their degradation. Expression of TACO in nonmacrophages prevented lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria and prolonged their intracellular survival. Active retention of TACO on phagosomes by living mycobacteria thus represents a mechanism preventing cargo delivery to lysosomes, allowing mycobacteria to survive within macrophages.},

This study focuses on LR aggregation induced in alveolar epithelial cells during infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli. We report dose- and time-dependent increases in LR aggregation after infection with three different strains at multiplicities of infection of 1, 10 and 100 from 2-24 hr post infection (hpi). Specific strain-dependent variations were noted among H37Rv, HN878 and CDC1551 with H37Rv producing the most significant increase from 15 aggregates per cell (APC) to 27 APC at MOI 100 during the 24 hour infection period. Treatment of epithelial cells with Culture Filtrate Protein, Total Lipids and gamma-irradiated whole cells from each strain failed to induce the level of LR aggregation observed during infection with any of the live strains. However, filtered supernatants from infected epithelial cells did produce comparable LR aggregation, suggesting a secreted mycobacterial product produced during infection of host cells is responsible for LR aggregation. Disruption of lipid raft formation prior to infection indicates that Mtb bacilli utilize LR aggregates for internalization and survival in epithelial cells. Treatment of host cells with the LR-disruption agent Filipin III produced a nearly 22\% reduction in viable bacteria for strains H37Rv and HN878, and a 7\% reduction for strain CDC1551 after 6 hpi. This study provides evidence for significant mycobacterial-induced changes in the plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial cells and that Mtb strains vary in their ability to facilitate aggregation and utilization of LR.},

Our research on the role of sphingolipids in HIV entry has led to the hypothesis that modulation of ceramide levels in target cells affects their susceptibility to HIV infection by rearranging HIV receptors. Cellular ceramide levels were modulated by application of pharmacological agents such as N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR, fenretinide), by treatment with sphingomyelinase (Smase), or by exogenous addition of long-chain ceramide, and determined after metabolic incorporation of [3H]sphingosine. Infectivity assays were performed by using a HeLa-derived indicator cell line, TZM-bl, CD4+ lymphocytes, and monocytes. We observed a dose-dependent inhibition by 4-HPR of infection of TZM-bl cells by a broad range of HIV-1 isolates at low micromolar concentrations with an IC50 of {$<$}1 μM for most isolates tested. Nearly complete inhibition was seen at 5 μM, a dose that enhanced ceramide levels by 50-100\%, yet was nontoxic to the cells. Treating cells with other pharmacological agents that enhanced ceramide levels, with Smase, or exogenous addition of long-chain ceramide also resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 infection. Enhancing ceramide levels in CD4+ lymphocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages with 4-HPR or Smase significantly reduced infectivity without toxicity. The minimal toxicity of normal cells exposed to 4-HPR should make the drug exceedingly suitable as an anti-HIV therapeutic.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Pathogenic mycobacteria are able to survive and proliferate in phagosomes within host macrophages (Mφ). This capability has been attributed in part to their cell wall, which consists of various unique lipids. Some of these are important in the host-pathogen interaction, such as resistance against microbicidal effector mechanisms and modulation of host cell functions, and/or are presented as Ags to T cells. Here we show that two lipids are released from the mycobacterial cell wall within the phagosome of infected Mφ and transported out of this compartment into intracellular vesicles. One of these lipids was identified as lysocardiolipin. Lysocardiolipin was generated through cleavage of mycobacterial cardiolipin by a Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 present in Mφ lysosomes. This result indicates that lysosomal host cell enzymes can interact with released mycobacterial lipids to generate new products with a different intracellular distribution. This represents a novel pathway for the modification of bacterial lipid Ags.},

Because BCG vaccination is used extensively in infants, this population group is likely to be the first in which efficacy trials of new vaccines will be conducted. However, our understanding of the complexity of immunity to BCG in infants is inadequate, making interpretation of vaccine-induced immune responses difficult.                                                        Methods                                To better understand BCG-induced immunity, we performed gene expression profiling in five 10-week old infants routinely vaccinated with BCG at birth. RNA was extracted from 12 hour BCG-stimulated or purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD)-stimulated PBMC, isolated from neonatal blood collected 10 weeks after vaccination. RNA was hybridised to the Sentrix                 ®                 HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) to measure expression of {$>$}16,000 genes.                                                        Results               We found that ex vivo stimulation of PBMC with PPD and BCG induced largely similar gene expression profiles, except that BCG induced greater macrophage activation. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, including PPAR-γ, involved in activation of the alternative, anti-inflammatory macrophage response was down-regulated following stimulation with both antigens. In contrast, up-regulation of genes associated with the classic, pro-inflammatory macrophage response was noted. Further analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including integrin alpha M (ITGAM), which is known to be important for entry of mycobacteria into the macrophage. Interestingly, more leukocyte genes were down-regulated than up-regulated.                                         Conclusion               Our results suggest that a combination of suppressed and up-regulated genes may be key in determining development of protective immunity to TB induced by vaccination with BCG.},

Specifically, we summarize studies addressing the ability of the organism to survive within macrophages by controlling phagolysosome fusion.

  abstract = {Summary             Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is known as having a poor prognosis with a weak response to therapy and very high death rates. The aim of this work was to assess the immune response to the RD1-encoded antigen ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in MDR-TB patients and compare to non-resistant (NR) TB patients and healthy controls (HC). Evaluation of interferon (IFN)-γ production showed that, although 55\% of the MDR patients were responsive to ESAT-6, they produced lower IFN-γ levels (553{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}11{$\quad$}pg/ml) when compared to NR-TB (1179{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}163{$\quad$}pg/ml; P{$\quad\&$}lt;{$\quad$}0·05) but not to controls (412{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}65·7{$\quad$}pg/ml). Differences in the response to ESAT-6 and to its overlapping peptides mixture were also significant between MDR versus treated pulmonary NR-TB. Furthermore, a very low rate of response to PPD (23·5\%) and to Ag85B (33·3\%) was noted in MDR-TB patients as compared to the other groups. To determine the inflammatory response in patients’ groups, detection of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed in their sera before and during chemotherapy. Mean TNF-α levels in MDR-TB (43·8{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}9{$\quad$}pg/ml) paralleled those found in treated pulmonary, and it was significantly different (P{$\quad\&$}lt;{$\quad$}0·05) from the values found in untreated NR and HC. Interestingly, secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α were predominant in MDR patients who presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions and lung cavitation. The present data indicate that the overall immune response to mycobacterial antigens is decreased in resistant TB and the major role inflammatory cytokines may play in perpetuating pulmonary tissue damage.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis overcomes macrophage bactericidal activities and persists intracellularly. One mechanism by which M. tuberculosis avoids macrophage killing might be through inhibition of IFN-gamma-mediated signaling. In this study we provide evidence that at least two distinct components of M. tuberculosis, the 19-kDa lipoprotein and cell wall peptidoglycan (contained in the mycolylarabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex), inhibit macrophage responses to IFN-gamma at a transcriptional level. Moreover, these components engage distinct proximal signaling pathways to inhibit responses to IFN-gamma: the 19-kDa lipoprotein inhibits IFN-gamma signaling in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)2-dependent and myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent fashion whereas mAGP inhibits independently of TLR2, TLR4, and myeloid differentiation factor 88. In addition to inhibiting the induction of specific IFN-gamma responsive genes, the 19-kDa lipoprotein and mAGP inhibit the ability of IFN-gamma to activate murine macrophages to kill virulent M. tuberculosis without inhibiting production of NO. These results imply that inhibition of macrophage responses to IFN-gamma may contribute to the inability of an apparently effective immune response to eradicate M. tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Phagosomal biogenesis is a fundamental biological process of particular significance for the function of phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. The precise mechanisms governing maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes are not completely understood. Here, we applied the property of pathogenic mycobacteria to cause phagosome maturation arrest in infected macrophages as a tool to dissect critical steps in phagosomal biogenesis. We report the requirement for 3-phosphoinositides and acquisition of Rab5 effector early endosome autoantigen (EEA1) as essential molecular events necessary for phagosomal maturation. Unlike the model phagosomes containing latex beads, which transiently recruited EEA1, mycobacterial phagosomes excluded this regulator of vesicular trafficking that controls membrane tethering and fusion processes within the endosomal pathway and is recruited to endosomal membranes via binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Ptdlns[3]P). Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3′(OH)-kinase (PI-3K) activity diminished EEA1 recruitment to newly formed latex bead phagosomes and blocked phagosomal acquisition of late endocytic properties, indicating that generation of Ptdlns(3)P plays a role in phagosomal maturation. Microinjection into macrophages of antibodies against EEA1 and the PI-3K hVPS34 reduced acquisition of late endocytic markers by latex bead phagosomes, demonstrating an essential role of these Rab5 effectors in phagosomal biogenesis. The mechanism of EEA1 exclusion from mycobacterial phagosomes was investigated using mycobacterial products. Coating of latex beads with the major mycobacterial cell envelope glycosylated phosphatidylinositol lipoarabinomannan isolated from the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, inhibited recruitment of EEA1 to latex bead phagosomes, and diminished their maturation. These findings define the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and EEA1 recruitment as: (a) important regulatory events in phagosomal maturation and (b) critical molecular targets affected by M. tuberculosis. This study also identifies mycobacterial phosphoinositides as products with specialized toxic properties, interfering with discrete trafficking stages in phagosomal maturation.},

  abstract = {Host-parasite interactions may be modulated by host- or parasite-associated microbes, but the role of these are often overlooked. Particularly for parasites with intestinal stages (either larval or adult), the host gut microbiome may play a key role for parasite establishment; moreover, the microbiome may change in response to invading parasites. Hypothesis testing at the organismal level may be hampered, particularly in mammalian definitive hosts, by ethical, logistical, and economical restrictions. Thus, invertebrates naturally serving as intermediate hosts to parasites with complex life cycles may inform the development of mammalian models as an early-stage host-parasite model. In addition, several important pathogens are vectored by insects, and insect gut microbiome-pathogen interactions may provide essential base-line knowledge, which may be used to control vectorborne pathogens. Here, we used the grain beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a host of the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta, to explore interactions between infection status and resident gut microbiota at two pre-determined time points (day two and seven) post infection. Using 16S/18S microbial profiling, we measured key parameters of the composition, relative abundance, and diversity of the host gut bacteriome and mycobiome. In addition, we quantified the systemic beetle immune response to infection by Phenoloxidase activity and hemocyte abundance. We found significant changes in the gut bacteriome and mycobiome in relation to infection status and beetle age. Thus, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the gut of infected beetles and driven mostly by an increased abundance of Acinetobacter. In addition, the mycobiome was less abundant in infected beetles but maintained higher Shannon diversity in infected compared with non-infected beetles. Beetles treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Tetracycline) exhibited significantly reduced parasite establishment compared with the untreated control group, indicating that the host microbiome may greatly influence hatching of eggs and subsequent establishment of H. diminuta larvae. Our results suggest that experimental work using invertebrates may provide a platform for explorative studies of host-parasite-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms.},

Na + , the primary cationic osmolyte internalized, exited endocytic vacuoles via two-pore channels, accompanied by parallel efflux of Cl − and osmotically coupled water. The resulting shrinkage caused crenation of the membrane, which fostered recruitment of curvature-sensing proteins. These proteins stabilized tubules and promoted their elongation, driving vacuolar remodeling, receptor recycling, and resolution of the organelles. Failure to resolve internalized fluid impairs the tissue surveillance activity of resident macrophages. Thus, osmotically driven increases in the surface-to-volume ratio of endomembranes promote traffic between compartments and help to ensure tissue homeostasis.},

From the rate of decrease of the specific radioactivities of the different constituents of short‐chain fatty acid sphingomyelins, we have calculated a half‐life of 65 days for sphingosine. 41 days for fatty acids and 62 days for phosphate. For the long‐chain fatty acid sphingomyelins the half‐life of sphingosine was approximately 465 days. The fatty acids and phosphate from these sphingomyelins had fast and slow turnover pools. The half‐life for the fast pool was 7 days for the two constituents and the estimated half‐lives for the slow pool were 220 days for fatty acids and 480 days for phosphate.                          These results suggest that one can distinguish at least three metabolic pools of brain sphingomyelins: (a) sphingomyelins with long‐chain fatty acids situated in myelin whose half‐lives are 465 days for sphingosine, 220 days for fatty acids and 480 days for phosphate; (b) sphingomyelins with long‐chain fatty acids located mainly in non‐myelin structures having half‐lives of 465 days for sphingosine. 7 days for fatty acids and 7 days for phosphate; (c) sphingomyeiins with short‐chain fatty acids with half‐lives of 65 days for sphingosine. 41 days for fatty acids and 62 days for phosphate. The differences between the half‐lives of the three metabolic pools of sphingomyelin, together with the subcellular localizations of the two molecular species of these compounds, suggest that the metabolism of the different molecular species of sphingomyelin are independent and that in various subcellular fractions the long‐chain fatty acid and short‐chain fatty acid sphingomyelins have different turnover rates.},

  abstract = {Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature and linked to fungal infection and asthma. However, bona fide immune receptors directly binding chitin and signaling immune activation and inflammation have not been clearly identified because polymeric crude chitin with unknown purity and molecular composition has been used. By using defined chitin (Nacetyl-glucosamine) oligomers, we here identify six-subunit-long chitin chains as the smallest immunologically active motif and the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR2) as a primary fungal chitin sensor on human and murine immune cells. Chitin oligomers directly bind TLR2 with nanomolar affinity, and this fungal TLR2 ligand shows overlapping and distinct signaling outcomes compared to known mycobacterial TLR2 ligands. Unexpectedly, chitin oligomers composed of five or less subunits are inactive, hinting to a size-dependent system of immuno-modulation that appears conserved in plants and humans. Since blocking of the chitin-TLR2 interaction effectively prevents chitin-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo, our study highlights the chitin-TLR2 interaction as a potential target for developing novel therapies in chitin-related pathologies and fungal disease.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils play a critical role in the host defense against bacterial and fungal infections, but their inappropriate activation also contributes to tissue damage during autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils express a large number of cell surface receptors for the recognition of pathogen invasion and the inflammatory environment. Those include G-protein-coupled chemokine and chemoattractant receptors, Fc-receptors, adhesion receptors such as selectins/selectin ligands and integrins, various cytokine receptors, as well as innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptors and C-type lectins. The various cell surface receptors trigger very diverse signal transduction pathways including activation of heterotrimeric and monomeric G-proteins, receptor-induced and store-operated Ca2 + signals, protein and lipid kinases, adapter proteins and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Here we provide an overview of the receptors involved in neutrophil activation and the intracellular signal transduction processes they trigger. This knowledge is crucial for understanding how neutrophils participate in antimicrobial host defense and inflammatory tissue damage and may also point to possible future targets of the pharmacological therapy of neutrophil-mediated autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. © 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of antiquity. Yet TB today still causes more adult deaths than any other single infectious disease. Recent studies show that contrary to the common view postulating an animal origin for TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative agent of TB, emerged as a human pathogen in Africa and colonized the world accompanying the Out-of-Africa migrations of modern humans. More recently, evolutionarily 'modern' lineages of MTBC expanded as a consequence of the global human population increase, and spread throughout the world following waves of exploration, trade and conquest. While epidemiological data suggest that the different phylogenetic lineages of MTBC might have adapted to different human populations, overall, the phylogenetically 'modern' MTBC lineages are more successful in terms of their geographical spread compared with the 'ancient' lineages. Interestingly, the global success of 'modern' MTBC correlates with a hypo-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, possibly reflecting higher virulence, and a shorter latency in humans. Finally, various human genetic variants have been associated with different MTBC lineages, suggesting an interaction between human genetic diversity and MTBC variation. In summary, the biology and the epidemiology of human TB have been shaped by the long-standing association between MTBC and its human host.},

As a result, we called this method ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM). Here we describe the step-by-step U-ExM protocol, as well as pitfalls and how to avoid them. We explain which steps may be modified in order to optimize the expansion and preservation of the structure of interest.

  abstract = {Ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) was first shown to be mitogenic for fibroblasts, but the mechanisms whereby it stimulated cell proliferation have remained largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1P stimulates DNA synthesis and cell division in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. C1P caused rapid phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Selective inhibition of PI3-K blocked both DNA synthesis and cell growth. C1P induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β, which is a major target of PKB, and this effect was also abolished by inhibition of PI3-K. In addition, C1P upregulated the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, two major targets of GSK-3β, which are important regulators of cell proliferation. C1P stimulated the activity of NF-κB, and inhibitors of this transcription factor completely blocked macrophage proliferation. Lastly, C1P induced phosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellularly regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK also blocked C1P-induced macrophage proliferation. It can be concluded that C1P stimulates macrophage proliferation through activation of the PI3-K/PKB, ERK and JNK pathways, and that GSK-3β, c-Myc, cyclin D1, and NF-κB are important downstream effectors in this action. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to TLRs, many other surface receptors have been proposed to participate in innate immunity and microbial recognition, and signaling through some of these receptors is likely to cooperate with TLR signaling in defining inflammatory responses. In this report we have examined how dectin-1, a lectin family receptor for beta-glucans, collaborates with TLRs in recognizing microbes. Dectin-1, which is expressed at low levels on macrophages and high levels on dendritic cells, contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like signaling motif that is tyrosine phosphorylated upon activation. The receptor is recruited to phagosomes containing zymosan particles but not to phagosomes containing immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Dectin-1 expression enhances TLR-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B by beta-glucan-containing particles, and in macrophages and dendritic cells dectin-1 and TLRs are synergistic in mediating production of cytokines such as interleukin 12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Additionally, dectin-1 triggers production of reactive oxygen species, an inflammatory response that is primed by TLR activation. The data demonstrate that collaborative recognition of distinct microbial components by different classes of innate immune receptors is crucial in orchestrating inflammatory responses.},

Here we show that molecular and pharmacological inhibition of nCDase in colon cancer cells increases ceramide, and this is accompanied by decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis and autophagy, with minimal effects on noncancerous cells. Inhibition of nCDase resultedinloss of β-catenin and inhibition of ERK, components of pathways relevant for colon cancer development. Furthermore, inhibition of nCDase in a xenograft model delayed tumor growth and increased ceramide while decreasing proliferation. It is noteworthy that mice lacking nCDase treated with azoxymethane were protected fromtumor formation. Taken together, these studies show that nCDase is pivotal for regulating initiation and development of colon cancer, and thesedata suggest that this enzyme is a suitable and novel target for colon cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {Salmonella species invade and replicate within epithelial cells in membrane-bound vacuoles. In this report we show that upon infection of HeLa epithelial cells, Salmonella typhimurium resides in vacuoles that contain lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (Igps). Four to six hours after invasion, intracellular bacteria induce the formation of stable filamentous structures containing Igps that are connected to the bacteria-containing vacuoles. Formation of these Igp-rich structures requires viable intracellular bacteria and is blocked by inhibitors of vacuolar acidification. These structures are not present in uninfected cells or in cells infected with another invasive bacteria, Yersinia enterocolitica. Tracers added to the extracellular medium are not delivered to the Salmonella-induced filaments, suggesting that these structures are different from previously described tubular lysosomes. Initiation of intracellular bacterial replication correlates with formation of these Igp-containing filaments. Certain avirulent Salmonella mutants that are defective for intracellular replication fail to induce formation of these structures. These observations suggest that Salmonella-induced filaments containing Igps are linked to intracellular bacterial replication.},

This system eliminates the need for enzymatic assembly and reduces all molecular cloning procedures to a single-tube, single-step PCR, performed in {$<$}2 hours from setup to transformation. Unlike other methods, IVA is a complete system, and offers significant advantages over alternative methods for all cloning procedures (insertions, deletions, site-directed mutagenesis and sub-cloning). Significantly, IVA allows unprecedented simplification of complex cloning procedures: five simultaneous modifications of any kind, multi-fragment assembly and library construction are performed in approximately half the time of current protocols, still in a single-step fashion. This system is efficient, seamless and sequence-independent, and requires no special kits, enzymes or proprietary bacteria, which will allow its immediate adoption by the academic and industrial molecular biology community.},

  abstract = {Fungal cell walls contain β-glucan polysaccharides that stimulate immune responses when recognized by host immune cells. The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum minimizes detection of β-glucan by host cells through at least two mechanisms: concealment of β-glucans beneath α-glucans and enzymatic removal of any exposed β-glucan polysaccharides by the secreted glucanase Eng1. Histoplasma yeasts also secrete the putative glucanase Exg8, which may serve a similar role as Eng1 in removing exposed β-glucans from the yeast cell surface. Here, we characterize the enzymatic specificity of the Eng1 and Exg8 proteins and show that Exg8 is an exo-β1,3-glucanase and Eng1 is an endo-β1,3-glucanase. Together, Eng1 and Exg8 account for nearly all of the total secreted glucanase activity of Histoplasma yeasts. Both Eng1 and Exg8 proteins are secreted through a conventional secretion signal and are modified post-translationally by O-linked glycosylation. Both glucanases have near maximal activity at temperature and pH conditions experienced during infection of host cells, supporting roles in Histoplasma pathogenesis. Exg8 has a higher specific activity than Eng1 for β1,3-glucans; yet despite this, Exg8 does not reduce detection of yeasts by the host β-glucan receptor Dectin-1. Exg8 is largely dispensable for virulence in vivo, in contrast to Eng1. These results show that Histoplasma yeasts secrete two β1,3-glucanases and that Eng1 endoglucanase activity is the predominant factor responsible for removal of exposed cell wall β-glucans to minimize host detection of Histoplasma yeasts.},

S1P receptor (S1                 PR                 ) signalling is associated with a wide variety of physiological processes including lymphocyte biology, their recirculation and determination of T‐cell phenotypes. The effect of                 FTY                 720 (Fingolimod, Gilenya™) to regulate lymphocyte egress and to ameliorate paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis led to the use of                 FTY                 720 as a first‐line oral agent for treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. However, a significant body of research suggests that S1P signalling may participate in diverse immune regulatory functions other than lymphocyte trafficking. This review article discusses the current knowledge of S1P signalling in the fate and function of T regulatory, T helper type 17 and memory T cells in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Tumor progression results from a complex interplay between cellular heterogeneity, treatment response, microenvironment and heterocellular interactions. Existing approaches to characterize this interplay suffer from an inability to distinguish between multiple cell types, often lack environmental context, and are unable to perform multiplex phenotypic profiling of cell populations. Here we present a high-throughput platform for characterizing, with single-cell resolution, the dynamic phenotypic responses (i.e. morphology changes, proliferation, apoptosis) of heterogeneous cell populations both during standard growth and in response to multiple, co-occurring selective pressures. The speed of this platform enables a thorough investigation of the impacts of diverse selective pressures including genetic alterations, therapeutic interventions, heterocellular components and microenvironmental factors. The platform has been applied to both 2D and 3D culture systems and readily distinguishes between (1) cytotoxic versus cytostatic cellular responses; and (2) changes in morphological features over time and in response to perturbation. These important features can directly influence tumor evolution and clinical outcome. Our image-based approach provides a deeper insight into the cellular dynamics and heterogeneity of tumors (or other complex systems), with reduced reagents and time, offering advantages over traditional biological assays. Tumors are dynamic, evolving systems whose multi-layered complexity stems from a number of microenviron-mental features including oxygen and nutrient gradients and interactions among diverse cell types (host and tumor, different molecular subtypes) 1-3. In preclinical studies, it has become increasingly important to capture the heterogeneity of tumors at the cellular and microenvironmental level in order to recapitulate a more realistic environmental context to study tumor progression and therapeutic response 4-6. Ignoring contextual influences when exploring these areas of research can be misleading. To determine cellular response to a perturbation, traditional biology assays for cell viability (e.g. MTS, alamar blue, Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry assay) are widely employed. Although these assays are robust and easy to perform, they often fail to provide a complete picture of cellular events 7. In particular, they tend to overlook alterations in additional cellular phenotypes, are not amenable to co-culturing different cell types, and are prone to missing absolute changes in cell population composition. These assays frequently depend on surrogate measurements of cell number (e.g. ATP levels or DNA content) and the data is expressed as relative events rather than as absolute cell counts. One major limitation of cell viability readouts is that they do not reveal whether a cell population has undergone growth arrest, cell death, or a combination of both when exposed to a perturbation. For example, a readout of 50\% cell viability after exposure to drug "x" can be interpreted as either (1) the cell doubling time was twice as long compared to the control population, or (2) twice as many cells died compared to the control population. Clinically, this has significant implications for predicting tumor growth kinetics, drug treatment response, and the likelihood of emergence of drug resistance, which translates to not being able to distinguish between drugs that are capable of inducing tumor shrinkage (cell death) versus prompting growth arrest (cell cycle arrest). Tumor compositions are extremely heterogeneous and many traditional viability assays are unable to decouple the effects from multiple cell types or resolve the heterogeneity found within a single cell type/subpopulation.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids constitute a class of lipids defined by their eighteen carbon amino-alcohol backbones which are synthesized in the ER from nonsphingolipid precursors. Modification of this basic structure is what gives rise to the vast family of sphingolipids that play significant roles in membrane biology and provide many bioactive metabolites that regulate cell function. Despite the diversity of structure and function of sphingolipids, their creation and destruction are governed by common synthetic and catabolic pathways. In this regard, sphingolipid metabolism can be imagined as an array of interconnected networks that diverge from a single common entry point and converge into a single common breakdown pathway. In their simplest forms, sphingosine, phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine serve as the backbones upon which further complexity is achieved. For example, phosphorylation of the C1 hydroxyl group yields the final breakdown products and/or the important signaling molecules sphingosine-1-phosphate, phytosphingosine-1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively. On the other hand, acylation of sphingosine, phytosphingosine, or dihydrosphingosine with one of several possible acyl CoA molecules through the action of distinct ceramide synthases produces the molecules defined as ceramide, phytoceramide, or dihydroceramide. Ceramide, due to the differing acyl CoAs that can be used to produce it, is technically a class of molecules rather than a single molecule and therefore may have different biological functions depending on the acyl chain it is composed of. At the apex of complexity is the group of lipids known as glycosphingolipids (GSL) which contain dozens of different sphingolipid species differing by both the order and type of sugar residues attached to their headgroups. Since these molecules are produced from ceramide precursors, they too may have differences in their acyl chain composition, revealing an additional layer of variation. The glycosphingolipids are divided broadly into two categories: glucosphingolipids and galactosphingolipids. The glucosphingolipids depend initially on the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) which attaches glucose as the first residue to the C1 hydroxyl position. Galactosphingolipids, on the other hand, are generated from galactosylceramide synthase (GalCerS), an evolutionarily dissimilar enzyme from GCS. Glycosphingolipids are further divided based upon further modification by various glycosyltransferases which increases the potential variation in lipid species by several fold. Far more abundant are the sphingomyelin species which are produced in parallel with glycosphingolipids, however they are defined by a phosphocholine headgroup rather than the addition of sugar residues. Although sphingomyelin species all share a common headgroup, they too are produced from a variety of ceramide species and therefore can have differing acyl chains attached to their C-2 amino groups. Whether or not the differing acyl chain lengths in SMs dictate unique functions or important biophysical distinctions has not yet been established. Understanding the function of all the existing glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin species will be a major undertaking in the future since the tools to study and measure these species are only beginning to be developed. The simple sphingolipids serve both as the precursors and the breakdown products of the more complex ones. Importantly, in recent decades, these simple sphingolipids have gained attention for having significant signaling and regulatory roles within cells. In addition, many tools have emerged to measure the levels of simple sphingolipids and therefore have become the focus of even more intense study in recent years.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a world-wide health risk and immunosuppression is a particular problem in M. tuberculosis infections. Although macrophages are primarily infected, dendritic cells (DCs) are important in inducing cellular immune responses against M. tuberculosis. We hypothesized that DCs represent a target for M. tuberculosis and that the observed immuno-suppression results from modulation of DC functions. We demonstrate that the DC-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN is an important receptor on DCs that captures and internalizes intact Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) through the mycobacterial cell wall component ManLAM. Antibodies against DC-SIGN block M. bovis BCG infection of DCs. ManLAM is also secreted by M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages and has been implicated as a virulence factor. Strikingly, ManLAM binding to DC-SIGN prevents mycobacteria- or LPS-induced DC maturation. Both mycobacteria and LPS induce DC maturation through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, suggesting that DC-SIGN, upon binding of ManLAM, interferes with TLR-mediated signals. Blocking antibodies against DC-SIGN reverse the ManLAM-mediated immunosuppressive effects. Our results suggest that M. tuberculosis targets DC-SIGN both to infect DCs and to down-regulate DC-mediated immune responses. Moreover, we demonstrate that DC-SIGN has a broader pathogen recognition profile than previously shown, suggesting that DC-SIGN may represent a molecular target for clinical intervention in infections other than HIV-1.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The hallmark of Mycobacterium-induced pathology is granulomatous inflammation at the site of infection. Mycobacterial lipids are potent immunomodulators that contribute to the granulomatous response and are released in appreciable quantities by intracellular bacilli. Previously we investigated the granulomagenic nature of the peripheral cell wall lipids of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) by coating the lipids onto 90-μm diameter microspheres that were mixed into Matrigel matrix with syngeneic bone marrow-derived macrophages and injected i.p. into mice. These studies demonstrated that BCG lipids elicit proinflammatory cytokines and recruit leukocytes. In the current study we determined the lipids responsible for this proinflammatory effect. BCG-derived cell wall lipids were fractionated and purified by liquid chromatography and preparative TLC. The isolated fractions including phosphatidylinositol dimannosides, cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, trehalose monomycolate, trehalose dimycolate, and mycoside B. Trehalose dimycolate, when delivered to bone marrow-derived murine macrophages, induced the greatest secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in vitro. Trehalose dimycolate similarly induced the greatest secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines in ex vivo matrices over the course of 12 days. Trehalose monomycolate and dimycolate also induced profound neutrophil recruitment in vivo. Experiments with TLR2 or TLR4 gene-deficient mice revealed no defects in responses to trehalose mycolates, although MyD88-deficient mice manifested significantly reduced cell recruitment and cytokine production. These results demonstrate that the trehalose mycolates, particularly trehalose dimycolate, are the most bioactive lipids in the BCG extract, inducing a proinflammatory cascade that influences granuloma formation.},

  abstract = {Cell membranes contain hundreds to thousands of individual lipid species that are of structural importance but also specifically interact with proteins. Due to their highly controlled synthesis and role in signaling events sphingolipids are an intensely studied class of lipids. In order to investigate their metabolism and to study proteins interacting with sphingolipids, metabolic labeling based on photoactivatable sphingoid bases is the most straightforward approach. In order to monitor protein-lipid-crosslink products, sphingosine derivatives containing a reporter moiety, such as a radiolabel or a clickable group, are used. In normal cells, degradation of sphingoid bases via action of the checkpoint enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase occurs at position C2-C3 of the sphingoid base and channels the resulting hexadecenal into the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway. In case the functionalized sphingosine looses the reporter moiety during its degradation, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling is maintained. In case degradation of a sphingosine derivative does not remove either the photoactivatable or reporter group from the resulting hexadecenal, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling can be achieved by blocking sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity and thus preventing sphingosine derivatives to be channeled into the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. Here we report an approach using clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease Cas9 to create a sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1) HeLa knockout cell line to disrupt the sphingolipidto-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. We found that the lipid and protein compositions as well as sphingolipid metabolism of SGPL1 knock-out HeLa cells only show little adaptations, which validates these cells as model systems to study transient protein-sphingolipid interactions.},

  abstract = {Upon infection, adaptive immune responses play catch-up with rapidly replicating pathogens. While mechanisms for efficient humoral responses to lymph-borne antigens have been characterized, the current paradigm for Tcell responses to infections and particulate vaccines involves delayed migration of peripheral antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) to lymph nodes (LNs), where they elicit effector Tcell responses. Utilizing whole LN 3D imaging, histo-cytometry, and intravital 2-photon microscopy, we have identified a specialized population of DCs, enriched in the LN-resident CD11b+ subset, which resides within the lymphatic sinus endothelium and scans lymph with motile dendrites. These DCs capture draining particles and present associated antigens to T lymphocytes, inducing Tcell responses much sooner than and independently of migratory DCs. Thus, strategic DC subset positioning in LNs limits a potentially costly delay in generation of Tcell responses to lymph-borne antigens, contributing to effective host defense. These findings are also highly relevant to vaccine design.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The present study was initiated to define the composition of the membrane proteome of the Natural Killer (NK) like cell line YTS. Isolated membranes were treated with reagents that have been reported to remove peripheral membrane proteins. Additional steps involving trifluoroethanol (TFE) were introduced in an effort to remove remaining nonintegral membrane proteins. This treatment resulted in the release of a subset of proteins without any apparent disruption of membrane integrity. The membranes were solubilized and digested with trypsin in 25\% TFE. The resulting peptides were separated using an off‐line two‐dimensional reversed phase LC technique at alkaline and acidic pHs. Mass spectrometric analysis identified 1843 proteins with high confidence scores. On the basis of the presence of transmembrane regions or evidence of posttranslational modifications and prediction algorithms, approximately 40\% of the identified proteins were predicted as plausible membrane proteins. The remaining species were largely involved in cellular processes and molecular functions that could be predicted to be transiently associated with membranes. The analytical approaches presented in this study offer robust generic methods for the identification and characterization of membrane proteins. These observations highlight the fact that the membrane is a dynamic entity that is composed of integral and stably associated proteins. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Silicosis is a chronic lung disease induced by the inhalation of crystalline silica. Exposure of cultured macrophages to crystalline silica leads to cell death; however, the mechanism of cell-particle interaction, the fate of particles, and the cause of death are unknown. Time-lapse imaging shows that mouse macrophages avidly bind particles that settle onto the cell surface and that cells also extend protrusions to capture distant particles. Using confocal optical sectioning, silica particles were shown to be present within the cytoplasmic volume of live cells. In addition, electron microscopy and elemental analysis showed silica in internal cellular sections. To further examine the phagocytosis process, the kinetics of particle uptake was quantified using an assay in which cells were exposed to ovalbumin (OVA)-coated particles, and an anti-OVA antibody was used to distinguish surface-bound from internalized particles. Fc receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-coated silica particles was nearly complete within 5 minutes. In contrast, no OVA-coated particles were internalized at this time. After 30 minutes, 30\% of bound silica was internalized and uptake continued slowly thereafter. OVA-coated latex beads, regardless of surface charge, were internalized at a similarly slow rate. These results demonstrate that macrophages internalize silica and that nonopsonized phagocytosis occurs by a temporally, and possibly mechanistically, distinct pathway from Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Eighty percent of macrophages die within 12 hours of silica exposure. Neither OVA coating nor tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate labeling has any effect on cell death. Interestingly, antibody coating dramatically reduces silica toxicity. We hypothesize that the route of particle entry and subsequent phagosome trafficking affects the toxicity of internalized particles.},

Mutations in TREM2 are associated with several diseases, including Nasu-Hakola disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TREM2 undergoes sequential proteolytic processing by ectodomain shedding and intramembrane proteolysis. We show that inhibition of γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of the TREM2 C-terminal fragment in cellular membranes interferes with TREM2-dependent signaling and cellular function. Inhibition of γ-secretase decreases membrane-proximal signaling and intracellular Ca2+ response. Decreased signaling alters morphological changes and phagocytic activity of cells upon selective stimulation of TREM2. The data demonstrate the importance of γ-secretase-dependent intramembrane processing in TREM2-mediated signaling and, thus, a functional relation of two AD-associated proteins.},

The drug may be administered topically to the skin, intravenously, orally, or topically to the eye (only topical and intravenous preparations are currently available). Acyclovir kinetics are described by a two-compartment open model. The drug and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal failure. Safety and tolerance studies in animals and humans have shown acyclovir to be very well tolerated. The most important adverse effect is crystalluria and elevated serum creatinine related to bolus intravenous administration. Other reported adverse effects include infusion site inflammation and rash. Topical acyclovir is effective for treating initial genital herpes and mucocutaneous herpes in the compromised host, but has not been shown to be clinically useful for recurrent labial or genital herpes. Intravenous acyclovir is effective for mucocutaneous herpes infections in the compromised host and initial genital herpes in the normal host; it is being evaluated for the treatment of herpes simplex virus encephalitis and varicella-zoster infections. An investigational oral preparation may prove to be effective therapy for both initial and recurrent genital herpes. Acyclovir therapy does not eliminate latent virus or prevent subsequent recurrences.}

A mechanism for the effect of cytochalasin D on actin polymerization is presented, which explains the experimental observation of a cytochalasin D-induced increase in the initial rate of polymerization and a decrease in the final extent of the reaction. Central to this mechanism is the Mg2+-dependent formation of cytochalasin D-induced dimers. The dimers serve as nuclei to enhance the polymerization rate. Binding of Mg2+ to a low affinity site on the dimer induces a conformational change which can be observed as a rapid fluorescence increase. A subsequent time-dependent fluorescence decrease observed prior to polymerization appears to represent ATP hydrolysis resulting in dissociation of the dimer and release of actin monomers containing ADP. We postulate that a slow rate of exchange of ATP for bound ADP relative to hydrolysis results in the accumulation of monomers containing ADP. As these monomers have a high critical concentration, the final extent of polymerization is reduced dramatically. The Mg2+ dependence of the final extent of polymerization in the presence of cytochalasin D is also explained in the context of this mechanism.},

  abstract = {Ceramide is a well-characterized sphingolipid metabolite and second messenger that participates in numerous biological processes. In addition to serving as a precursor to complex sphingolipids, ceramide is a potent signaling molecule capable of regulating vital cellular functions. Perhaps its major role in signal transduction is to induce cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis. In contrast, little is known about the metabolic or signaling pathways that are regulated by the phosphorylated form of ceramide. It was first demonstrated that ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) had mitogenic properties, and more recently it has been described as potent inhibitor of apoptosis and inducer of cell survival. C1P and ceramide are antagonistic molecules that can be interconverted in cells by kinase and phosphatase activities. An appropriate balance between the levels of these two metabolites seems to be crucial for cell and tissue homeostasis. Switching this balance towards accumulation of one or the other may result in metabolic dysfunction, or disease. Therefore, the activity of the enzymes that are involved in C1P and ceramide metabolism must be efficiently coordinated to ensure normal cell functioning. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of electronic cigarettes in phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cytokines production. In vitro infection was carried out by exposing THP-1 macrophages to four electronic vapor extracts and the intracellular burden of M. tuberculosis was determined. The percentage of infection was evaluated by confocal microscopy and the cytokine production by Luminex. A reduction of intracellular M. tuberculosis burden in THP- 1 macrophages was found after its exposure to electronic vapor extract; the same trend was observed by confocal microscopy when Mycobacterium bovis BCG-GFP strain was used. Electronic cigarettes stimulate a pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We conclude that electronic cigarettes impair the phagocytic function and the cytokine response to M. tuberculosis.},

It is a complex problem that needs to be understood in a multi-dimensional way for effective management. Most research to date has been based in specialist clinics rather than in primary care, with consequently limited findings. Chronic pain differs from acute pain in that management follows a rehabilitative rather than a treatment model, though these are not mutually exclusive. Full assessment of the patient, preferably multi-disciplinary, will improve his or her outlook. Management should be holistic, rigorous in the application of conventional therapies (including analgesics and physical therapy) and ready to admit an improved understanding of psychological and social techniques. There may be a role for complementary therapies. As a large proportion of chronic pain presents only in the community, there may be a role for greater primary care input to management},

  abstract = {Fungi, usually present as commensals, are a major cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Such infections, if not diagnosed or treated properly, can prove fatal. However, in most cases healthy individuals are able to avert the fungal attacks by mounting proper antifungal immune responses. Among the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are the major players in antifungal immunity. CLRs can recognize carbohydrate ligands, such as β-glucans and mannans, which are mainly found on fungal cell surfaces. They induce proinflammatory immune reactions, including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, cytokine, and chemokine production from innate effector cells, as well as activation of adaptive immunity via Th17 responses. CLRs such as Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Mincle, mannose receptor (MR), and DC-SIGN can recognize many disease-causing fungi and also collaborate with each other as well as other PRRs in mounting a fungi-specific immune response. Mutations in these receptors affect the host response and have been linked to a higher risk in contracting fungal infections. This review focuses on how CLRs on various immune cells orchestrate the antifungal response and on the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these receptors toward the risk of developing such infections.},

  abstract = {As structural membrane components and signaling effector molecules sphingolipids influence a plethora of host cell functions, and by doing so also the replication of viruses. Investigating the effects of various inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and the human B cell line BJAB we found that not only the sphingosine kinase (SphK) inhibitor SKI-II, but also the acid ceramidase inhibitor ceranib-2 efficiently inhibited measles virus (MV) replication. Virus uptake into the target cells was not grossly altered by the two inhibitors, while titers of newly synthesized MV were reduced by approximately 1 log (90\%) in PBL and 70–80\% in BJAB cells. Lipidomic analyses revealed that in PBL SKI-II led to increased ceramide levels, whereas in BJAB cells ceranib-2 increased ceramides. SKI-II treatment decreased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in PBL and BJAB cells. Furthermore, we found that MV infection of lymphocytes induced a transient (0.5–6 h) increase in S1P, which was prevented by SKI-II. Investigating the effect of the inhibitors on the metabolic (mTORC1) activity we found that ceranib-2 reduced the phosphorylation of p70 S6K in PBL, and that both inhibitors, ceranib-2 and SKI-II, reduced the phosphorylation of p70 S6K in BJAB cells. As mTORC1 activity is required for efficient MV replication, this effect of the inhibitors is one possible antiviral mechanism. In addition, reduced intracellular S1P levels affect a number of signaling pathways and functions including Hsp90 activity, which was reported to be required for MV replication. Accordingly, we found that pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 with the inhibitor 17-AAG strongly impaired MV replication in primary PBL. Thus, our data suggest that treatment of lymphocytes with both, acid ceramidase and SphK inhibitors, impair MV replication by affecting a number of cellular activities including mTORC1 and Hsp90, which alter the metabolic state of the cells causing a hostile environment for the virus.},

  abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major respiratory pathogen of both humans and animals. The lung is protected from pathogens by alveolar epithelial cells, tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. The role of alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and alveolar macrophages during IAV infection has been studied previously. In this study, we address the role of mast cells during IAV infection. Respiratory infection with A/WSN/33 causes significant disease and immunopathology in C57BL/6 mice but not in B6.Cg-KitW-sh mice, which lack mast cells. During in vitro coculture, A/WSN/33 caused mast cells to release histamine, secrete cytokines and chemokines, and produce leukotrienes. Moreover, when mast cells were infected with IAV, the virus did not replicate within mast cells. Importantly, human H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B virus isolates also could activate mast cells in vitro. Mast cell production of cytokines and chemokines occurs in a RIG-I/MAVS-dependent mechanism; in contrast, histamine production occurred through a RIG-I/MAVS-independent mechanism. Our data highlight that, following IAV infection, the response of mast cells is controlled by multiple receptors. In conclusion, we identified a unique inflammatory cascade activated during IAV infection that could potentially be targeted to limit morbidity following IAV infection.

  abstract = {Significant insights into disease pathogenesis have been gleaned from population-level genetic studies; however, many loci associated with complex genetic disease contain numerous genes, and phenotypic associations cannot be assigned unequivocally. In~particular, a gene-dense locus on chromosome 11 (61.5–61.65 Mb) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Here, we identify TMEM258 within this locus as a central regulator of intestinal inflammation. Strikingly, Tmem258 haploinsufficient mice exhibit severe intestinal inflammation in a model of colitis. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that TMEM258 is a required component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and is essential for N-linked protein glycosylation. Consequently, homozygous deficiency of Tmem258 in colonic organoids results in unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress culminating in apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TMEM258 is a central mediator of ER quality control and intestinal homeostasis.},

Complementation of ASM-deficient fibroblasts from Niemann-Pick disease patients restored N. gonorrhoeae-induced signaling and entry processes.

Using a human challenge model, we showed that 29\% of our study population was homozygous recessive for the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene (FUT2) in the ABH histo-blood group family and did not express the H type-1 oligosaccharide ligand required for Norwalk virus binding. The FUT2 susceptibility allele was fully penetrant against Norwalk virus infection as none of these individuals developed an infection after challenge, regardless of dose. Of the susceptible population that encoded a functional FUT2 gene, a portion was resistant to infection, suggesting that a memory immune response or some other unidentified factor also affords protection from Norwalk virus infection.},

  abstract = {The cell membrane contains very small distinct membrane domains enriched of sphingomyelin and cholesterol that are named rafts. We have shown that the formation of ceramide via activation of the acid sphingomyelinase transforms rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. These platforms are required for infection of mammalian cells with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Neisseriae gonorrhoeae. In the present study we determined whether the acid sphingomyelinase, ceramide, and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms are also involved in the infection of human cells with pathogenic rhinoviruses. We demonstrate that infection of human epithelial cells with several rhinovirus strains triggers a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase correlating with microtubules- and microfilament-mediated translocation of the enzyme from an intracellular compartment onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane. The activity of the acid sphingomyelinase results in the formation of ceramide in the cell membrane and, finally, large ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. Rhinoviruses colocalize with ceramide-enriched membrane platforms during the infection. The significance of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for rhinoviral uptake is demonstrated by the finding that genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase prevented infection of human epithelial cells by rhinoviruses. The data identify the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide as key molecules for the infection of human cells with rhinoviruses. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

In the present study, we report that natural lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine 1‐phosphate, reduce               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               ‐induced cytotoxicity and enhance anti‐mycobacterial activity in the A549 cell line, used as a model of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Intracellular mycobacterial killing was strictly dependent on phagolysosome maturation, which in turn was promoted by the activation of a Ca               2+               dependent phospholipase D. Finally, the restriction of mycobacteria in highly microbiocidal compartments was associated,               in vitro               , with a significant decrease in mycobacterial dissemination to macrophages. Taken as whole, these results suggest that the pulmonary lysophospholipid microenvironment may play a protective role during the early phases of host–pathogen interaction by enhancing anti‐mycobacterial activity in type II alveolar epithelial cells.},

Greenwood               et al.               developed an approach to visualize antibiotics in human macrophages infected with the tubercle bacillus (see the Perspective by Smith and Aldridge). They showed that the antitubercular (anti-TB) drug bedaquiline accumulated in host lipid droplets. Lipid droplets seemed to act as an antibiotic reservoir that could be transferred to bacteria during host lipid consumption. Indeed, alterations in host lipid droplet content affected the anti-TB activity of bedaquiline against intracellular bacilli.

Sterilizing chemotherapy requires at least 6 months of multidrug therapy. Difficulty visualizing the subcellular localization of antibiotics in infected host cells means that it is unclear whether antibiotics penetrate all mycobacteria-containing compartments in the cell. Here, we combined correlated light, electron, and ion microscopy to image the distribution of bedaquiline in infected human macrophages at submicrometer resolution. Bedaquiline accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets, but heterogeneously in mycobacteria within a variety of intracellular compartments. Furthermore, lipid droplets did not sequester antibiotic but constituted a transferable reservoir that enhanced antibacterial efficacy. Thus, strong lipid binding facilitated drug trafficking by host organelles to an intracellular target during antimicrobial treatment.},

  abstract = {To understand the adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the intracellular environment, we used comprehensive metabolite profiling to identify the biochemical pathways utilized during growth on cholesterol, a critical carbon source during chronic infection. Metabolic alterations observed during cholesterol catabolism centered on propionyl-CoA and pyruvate pools. Consequently, growth on this substrate required the transcriptional induction of the propionyl-CoA-assimilating methylcitrate cycle (MCC) enzymes, via the Rv1129c regulatory protein. We show that both Rv1129c and the MCC enzymes are required for intracellular growth in macrophages and that the growth defect of MCC mutants is largely attributable to the degradation of host-derived cholesterol. Together, these observations define a coordinated transcriptional and metabolic adaptation that is required for scavenging carbon during intracellular growth. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, it was shown that APP processing is sensitive to cholesterol and other lipids. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and sphingomyelinases (SMases) are the main enzymes that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis and sphingomyelin (SM) levels, respectively. We show that control of cholesterol and SM metabolism involves APP processing. Abeta42 directly activates neutral SMase and downregulates SM levels, whereas Abeta40 reduces cholesterol de novo synthesis by inhibition of HMGR activity. This process strictly depends on gamma-secretase activity. In line with altered Abeta40/42 generation, pathological presenilin mutations result in increased cholesterol and decreased SM levels. Our results demonstrate a biological function for APP processing and also a functional basis for the link that has been observed between lipids and Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

They are important structural components of the membrane but can also act as second messengers in various signaling pathways. Until recently, ceramides and dihydroceramides were considered as a single functional class of lipids and no distinction was made between molecules with different chain lengths. However, based on the development of high-throughput, structure-specific and quantitative analytical methods to measure ceramides, it has now become clear that in cellular systems the amounts of ceramides differ with respect to their chain length. Further studies have indicated that some functions of ceramides are chain-length dependent. In this review, we discuss the chain length-specific differences of ceramides including their pathological impact on Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis and cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Lag1p and Lac1p are two highly homologous membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. lag1Δ lac1Δ double mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lack an acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthase and are either very sick or nonviable, depending on the genetic background. LAG1 and LAC1 are members of a large eukaryotic gene family that shares the Lag1 motif, and some members of this family additionally contain a DNA-binding HOX homeodomain. Here we show that several human LAG1 homologues can rescue the viability of lag1Δ lac1Δ yeast cells and restore acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide and sphingolipid biosynthesis. When tested in a microsomal assay, Lac1p and Lag1p had a strong preference for C26:0-CoA over C24:0-CoA, C20-CoA, and C16-CoA, whereas some human homologues preferred C24:0-CoA and CoA derivatives with shorter fatty acids. This suggests that LAG1 proteins are related to substrate recognition and to the catalytic activity of ceramide synthase enzymes. CLN8, another human LAG1 homologue implicated in ceroid lipofuscinosis, could not restore viability to lag1Δ lac1Δ yeast mutants.},

Major depressive disorder is often treated with anti‐depressants. Although these drugs have been used for many years, their exact mode of action is still unknown. It has been suggested that many anti‐depressants act by increasing the concentrations of serotonergic transmitters in the synaptic space. However, recent studies have examined the effects of anti‐depressants on neurogenesis in the hippocampus, the restoration of hippocampal neuronal networks that may be affected by major depression, and the regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis by immature neurons in the hippocampus. Here, we present and discuss a novel hypothesis suggesting that these events are regulated by the concentrations of sphingolipids, in particular ceramide, in the hippocampus. These concepts suggest that the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of major depression and may be a novel target for anti‐depressants.                                                   image                                               Major depressive disorder is a severe and chronic illness with high lifetime prevalence and high incidence of suicide. Major depression is caused in part by an imbalance between factors that positively and negatively control neurogenesis. Anti‐depressants inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system and thereby reduce the sum of negative factors restoring neurogenesis, neuronal survival, and improved mood.},

  author = {Gupta, Arun K and Rudney2, Harry},
  abstract = {We have examined the mechanism of the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in cells treated with exogenous sphingo-myelinase. Treatment of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), human skin fibroblasts (GM-43), and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells in culture with sphingomyelinase resulted in a concentration-and time-dependent inhibition of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, a key regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The following observations were obtained with IEC-6 cells. Free fatty acid synthesis or general cellular protein synthesis was unaffected by the addition of sphingomyelinase. Addition of sphingomyelinase to the in vitro reductase assay had no effect on activity, suggesting that an intact cell system is required for the action of sphingomyelinase. The products of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, e.g., ceramide and phosphocholine, had no effect on reductase activity. Sphingosine, a further product of ceramide metabolism, caused a stimulation of reductase activity. Examination of the incorporation of [3H]acetate into the nonsaponifiable lipid fractions in the presence of sphingo-myelinase showed no changes in the percent distribution of radioactivity in the post-mevalonate intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, but there was increased radioactivity associated with the polar sterol fraction. Pretreat-ment of cells with ketoconazole, a known inhibitor of oxysterol formation, prevented the inhibition of reductase activity by sphingomyelinase and decreased the incorporation of [3H]ace-tate in the polar sterol fraction. Ketoconazole had no effect on exogenous sphingomyelinase activity in vitro in the presence or absence of cells. Endogenous sphingomyelinase activity was also unaffected by ketoconazole. Addition of inhibitors of endo-genous sphingomyelinase activity, e.g., chlorpromazine, desi-pramine, and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-l-naphthalene sulfonamide (W-7), to the culture medium caused a dose-dependent stimulation of reductase activity. However, these agents had no effect on the inhibition of reductase activity by exogenous sphingomyelinase. Treatment of cells with small unilamellar vesicles of dioleyl phosphatidylcholine or high density lipoprotein, resulted in increased efflux of cholesterol and stimulation of reductase activity. Under similar conditions, the inhibitory effect of exogenous sphingomyelinase on reductase activity was prevented by incubation with small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine or high density lipopro-tein. ii These results support the hypothesis that alteration of the ratio of sphingomye1in:cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays a modulatory role on the flow of membrane cholesterol to a site where it may be converted to a putative regulatory molecule , possibly an oxysterol.-Gupta, A.

  abstract = {Abstract                        Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of mammalian cell membranes and particularly abundant in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. Its production is catalyzed by SM synthases SMS1 and SMS2, which interconvert phosphatidylcholine and ceramide to diacylglycerol and SM in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. As the lipids participating in this reaction fulfill both structural and signaling functions, SMS enzymes have considerable potential to influence diverse important cellular processes. The nematode             Caenorhabditis elegans             is an attractive model for studying both animal development and human disease. The organism contains five SMS homologues but none of these have been characterized in any detail. Here, we carried out the first systematic analysis of SMS family members in             C. elegans             . Using heterologous expression systems, genetic ablation, metabolic labeling and lipidome analyses, we show that             C. elegans             harbors at least three distinct SM synthases and one ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Moreover,             C. elegans             SMS family members have partially overlapping but also unique subcellular distributions and together occupy all principal compartments of the secretory pathway. Our findings shed light on crucial aspects of sphingolipid metabolism in a valuable animal model and opens avenues for exploring the role of SM and its metabolic intermediates in organismal development.},

  abstract = {© 2015 American Chemical Society.Sphingolipids are essential structural components of cellular membranes and are crucial regulators of cellular processes. While current high-throughput approaches allow for the systematic mapping of interactions of soluble proteins with their lipid-binding partners, photo-cross-linking is the only technique that enables for the proteome-wide mapping of integral membrane proteins with their direct lipid environment. Here, we report the synthesis of a photoactivatable and clickable analog of sphingosine (pacSph). When administered to sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase deficient cells, pacSph allows its metabolic fate and the subcellular flux of de novo synthesized sphingolipids to be followed in a time-resolved manner. The chemoproteomic profiling yielded over 180 novel sphingolipid-binding proteins, of which we validated a number, demonstrating the unique value of this technique as a discovery tool. This work provides an important resource for the understanding of the global cellular interplay between sphingolipids and their interacting proteins.},

  abstract = {Each intracellular organelle critically depends on maintaining its specific lipid composition that in turn contributes to the biophysical properties of the membrane. With our knowledge increasing about the organization of membranes with defined microdomains of different lipid compositions, questions arise regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the targeting to/segregation from microdomains of a given protein. In addition to specific lipid-transmembrane segment interactions as a basis for partitioning, the presence in a given microdomain may alter the conformation of proteins and, thus, the activity and availability for regulatory modifications. However, for most proteins, the specific lipid environment of transmembrane segments as well as its relevance to protein function and overall membrane organization are largely unknown. To help fill this gap, we have synthesized a novel photoactive sphingolipid precursor that, together with a precursor for phosphoglycerolipids and with photo-cholesterol, was investigated in vivo with regard to specific protein transmembrane spanlipid interactions. As a proof of principle, we show specific labeling of the ceramide transporter with the sphingolipid probe and describe specific in vivo interactions of lipids with caveolin-1, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein β, and the mature form of nicastrin. This novel photolabile sphingolipid probe allows the detection of protein-sphingolipid interactions within the membrane bilayer of living cells.

  abstract = {Vacuolar-type (V) ATPases are thought to be the main determinant of phagosomal acidification. In phagosomes containing mycobacteria, which ostensibly impair the delivery of V-ATPases to the phagosomal membrane, the pH would be expected to be near neutral. This prediction was tested by microfluorescence ratio imaging using macrophages from mice susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Although less acidic than their counterparts containing dead bacteria, phagosomes containing live Mycobacteria bovis were nearly 1 pH unit more acidic than the cytosol, suggesting the existence of alternate H+ transport mechanisms. We therefore investigated whether Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) contributes to phagosomal acidification. Immunoblotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and pharmacological studies indicated that NHE1 is the predominant isoform of the exchanger in macrophages. Fractionation revealed that NHE1 is incorporated into the phagosomal membrane, and measurements of pH indicated that it is functional in this location. Nevertheless, acidification of the lumen of phagosomes containing either latex beads or live M. bovis was insensitive to (3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)-guanidine methanesulfonate, a potent inhibitor of NHE1. This may have been due to the absence of an appropriate lumen to cytosol Na+ gradient, because the phagosomal membrane was found to be devoid of Na+/K+ pumps. Unexpectedly, the acidification of M. bovis phagosomes was fully reversed by specific inhibitors of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, suggesting that ATPases are present only transiently or in reduced quantities in the phagosomal membrane. Alternatively, acid equivalents accumulated in endosomes by V-ATPases may be delivered to the mycobacterial phagosome by carrier vesicles devoid of ATPases.},

A common feature among positive-strand RNA viruses is their assembly of replication-transcription complexes in association with cytoplasmic membranes.

Double-stranded RNA, presumably functioning as replicative intermediate during viral RNA synthesis, has been detected at the double-membrane vesicle interior. Recent studies have provided new insights into the assembly and functioning of the coronavirus replicative structures. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the biogenesis of the replicative structures, the membrane anchoring of the replication-transcription complexes, and the location of viral RNA synthesis, with particular focus on the dynamics of the coronavirus replicative structures and individual replication-associated proteins. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The genetic deletion of Rac1 and Rac2 prevents phagocytosis mediated by integrin and Fcγ receptors (FcγR), whereas the genetic deletion of Vav1 and Vav3 only prevents integrin-mediated phagocytosis through the complement receptor αMβ 2. In addition, a Rac1/2 or Vav1/3 deficiency blocks Arp2/3 recruitment and actin polymerization at the complement-induced phagosome, indicating that these proteins regulate early steps in phagocytosis. Moreover, constitutively active Rac is able to rescue actin polymerization and complement-mediated phagocytosis in Vav-deficient macrophages. These studies indicate that Rac is critical for complement- and FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. In contrast, Vav is specifically required for complement-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that Rac is regulated by GEFs other than Vav downstream of the FcγR. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.},

Using immunoelectron microscopy, we localize to the Golgi stack the glycosyltransferases that produce glucosylceramide (GlcCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), and GM3. GlcCer is synthesized on the cytosolic side and must translocate across to the Golgi lumen for LacCer synthesis. However, only very little natural GlcCer translocates across the Golgi in vitro. As GlcCer reaches the cell surface when Golgi vesicular trafficking is inhibited, it must translocate across a post-Golgi membrane. Concanamycin, a vacuolar proton pump inhibitor, blocks translocation independently of multidrug transporters that are known to translocate short-chain GlcCer. Concanamycin did not reduce LacCer and GM3 synthesis. Thus, GlcCer destined for glycolipid synthesis follows a different pathway and transports back into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the late Golgi protein FAPP2. FAPP2 knockdown strongly reduces GM3 synthesis. Overall, we show that newly synthesized GlcCer enters two pathways: one toward the noncytosolic surface of a post-Golgi membrane and one via the ER toward the Golgi lumen LacCer synthase.},

In the present study, we show that CD4 interacts with a reconstituted patch of GM3 by measuring the surface pressure with a Langmuir film balance. A biphasic increase in surface pressure is observed after the sequential addition of CD4 and gp120 under the GM3 monolayer, indicating the formation of the trimolecular complex GM3-CD4-gp120. Neutralization of gp120 with an anti-V3 antibody inhibits the secondary interaction with GM3, suggesting that the CD4-induced conformational change in gp120 allows the V3 loop to interact with GM3. In conclusion, this study supports the concept that glycolipids can function as HIV-1 fusion cofactors.},

This review focuses on recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular biology of SPT. SPT belongs to a family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent alpha-oxoamine synthases (POAS). Mammalian SPT is a heterodimer of 53-kDa LCB1 and 63-kDa LCB2 subunits, both of which are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) most likely with the type I topology, whereas other members of the POAS family are soluble homodimer enzymes. LCB2 appears to be unstable unless it is associated with LCB1. Potent inhibitors of SPT structurally resemble an intermediate in a probable multistep reaction mechanism for SPT. Although SPT is a housekeeping enzyme, its activity is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and its up-regulation is suggested to play a role in apoptosis induced by certain types of stress. Specific missense mutations in the human LCB1 gene cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type I, an autosomal dominantly inherited disease, and these mutations confer dominant-negative effects on SPT activity.}

After validating select hits in focused miniscreens, orthogonal assays and primary human macrophages, we show that (1) the previously uncharacterized gene NHLRC2 is a central player in phagocytosis, regulating RhoA-Rac1 signaling cascades that control actin polymerization and filopodia formation, (2) very-long-chain fatty acids are essential for efficient phagocytosis of certain substrates and (3) the previously uncharacterized Alzheimer’s disease–associated gene TM2D3 can preferentially influence uptake of amyloid-β aggregates. These findings illuminate new regulators and core principles of phagocytosis, and more generally establish an efficient method for unbiased identification of cellular uptake mechanisms across diverse physiological and pathological contexts.},

Both sterols and sphingolipids differ in their structural features in vertebrates, plants, and fungi. Interestingly, some invertebrates cannot synthesize sterols de novo and seem to have a reduced dependence on sterols. Sphingolipids and sterols are found in the plasma membrane, but we do not have a clear picture of their precise intracellular localization. Advances in lipidomics and subcellular fractionation should help to improve this situation. Genetic approaches have provided insights into the diversity of sterol and sphingolipid functions in eukaryotes providing evidence that these two lipid classes function together. Intermediates in sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation are involved in signaling pathways, whereas sterol structures are converted to hormones. Both lipids have been implicated in regulating membrane trafficking. © 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

To what extent adipose tissue also contributes to immune surveillance and long-term protective defense remains largely unknown. Here, we have shown that at steady state, white adipose tissue contained abundant memory lymphocyte populations. After infection, white adipose tissue accumulated large numbers of pathogen-specific memory T cells, including tissue-resident cells. Memory T cells in white adipose tissue expressed a distinct metabolic profile, and white adipose tissue from previously infected mice was sufficient to protect uninfected mice from lethal pathogen challenge. Induction of recall responses within white adipose tissue was associated with the collapse of lipid metabolism in favor of antimicrobial responses. Our results suggest that white adipose tissue represents a memory T cell reservoir that provides potent and rapid effector memory responses, positioning this compartment as a potential major contributor to immunological memory. The role of adipose tissue in protective immunity is largely unknown. Han et al. reveal that white adipose tissue is a reservoir for memory T cells endowed with a distinct functional and metabolic profile. These memory T cells are able to protect against infection while inducing physiological remodeling of adipose tissue.},

We obtained reliable lipidomics datasets from mutant cells generated with GENF, which was impossible when using clones.

We also demonstrate the possibility to dissect complex lipid co-regulatory networks and provide some common mechanisms explaining the adaptations to altered lipid metabolism.

Thus, ideal in vitro models for examining cellular responses to respiratory pathogens polarize, forming apical and basolateral surfaces. One such model is differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). However, this system requires lung tissue samples, expertise isolating and culturing epithelial cells from tissue, and time to generate an air-liquid interface culture. Calu-3 cells, derived from a human bronchial adenocarcinoma, are an alternative model for examining the response of proximal airway epithelial cells to respiratory insult, pharmacological compounds, and bacterial and viral pathogens, including influenza virus, rhinovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Recently, we demonstrated that Calu-3 cells are susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a manner consistent with NHBE. Here, we detail the establishment of a polarized, liquid-covered culture (LCC) of Calu-3 cells, focusing on the technical details of growing and culturing Calu-3 cells, maintaining cells that have been cultured into LCC, and we present the method for performing respiratory virus infection of polarized Calu-3 cells. To consistently obtain polarized Calu-3 LCC, Calu-3 cells must be carefully subcultured before culturing in Transwell inserts. Calu-3 monolayer cultures should remain below 90\% confluence, should be subcultured fewer than 10 times from frozen stock, and should regularly be supplied with fresh medium. Once cultured in Transwells, Calu-3 LCC must be handled with care. Irregular media changes and mechanical or physical disruption of the cell layers or plates negatively impact polarization for several hours or days. Polarization is monitored by evaluating trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and is verified by evaluating the passive equilibration of sodium fluorescein between the apical and basolateral compartments . Once TEER plateaus at or above 1,000 Ω×cm(2), Calu-3 LCC are ready to use to examine cellular responses to respiratory pathogens.},

  abstract = {Objective: In countries where parasitic infections are endemic, autoimmune disease is relatively rare, leading to the hypothesis that parasite-derived immunomodulators may protect against its development. Consistent with this, we have previously demonstrated that ES-62, a 62 kDa phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing glycoprotein that is secreted by filarial nematodes, can exert anti-inflammatory action in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and human rheumatoid arthritis-derived synovial tissue cultures. As a first step to developing ES-62-based drugs, the aim of this study was to determine whether the PC-moiety of ES-62 was responsible for its anti-inflammatory actions. Methods: We compared the anti-inflammatory activity of a PC-free form of recombinant ES-62 (rES-62) and a synthetic PC-ovalbumin conjugate (OVA-PC) with that of native ES-62 in the CIA model and synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Results: The anti-inflammatory actions of ES-62 in CIA appear to be dependent on the PC moiety as indicated by the reduction in severity of disease and also suppression of collagen-specific T helper 1 cytokine production observed when testing OVA-PC, but not rES-62. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory activity of PC did not correlate with a reduction in anti-collagen IgG2a levels. Also, the ES-62-mediated suppression of interferon-γ from human patient tissues could be mimicked by OVA-PC but not rES-62 or ovalbumin. Conclusions: In countries where filariasis is endemic the reduced detection of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis may be because of the anti-inflammatory action of the PC moieties of ES-62. PC may thus provide the starting point for the development of novel, safe immunomodulatory therapies.},

Here we demonstrate that this maturation process involves the GTPase Rab7. Rab7 recruitment to phagosomes was found to precede and to be essential for their fusion with late endosomes and/or lysosomes. Active Rab7 on the phagosomal membrane associates with the effector protein RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein), which in turn bridges phagosomes with dynein-dynactin, a microtubule-associated motor complex. The motors not only displace phagosomes in the centripetal direction but, strikingly, promote the extension of phagosomal tubules toward late endocytic compartments. Fusion of tubules with these organelles was documented by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tubule extension and fusion with late endosomes and/or lysosomes were prevented by expression of a truncated form of RILP lacking the dynein-dynactin-recruiting domain. We conclude that full maturation of phagosomes requires the retrograde emission of tubular extensions, which are generated by activation of Rab7, recruitment of RILP, and consequent association of phagosomes with microtubule-associated motors.},

This review covers recent highlights from studies of the structures, mechanisms and inhibitors of key enzymes from the sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.           ,              A new review covering up to 2018             Sphingolipids are essential molecules that, despite their long history, are still stimulating interest today. The reasons for this are that, as well as playing structural roles within cell membranes, they have also been shown to perform a myriad of cell signalling functions vital to the correct function of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Indeed, sphingolipid disregulation that alters the tightly-controlled balance of these key lipids has been closely linked to a number of diseases such as diabetes, asthma and various neuropathologies. Sphingolipid biogenesis, metabolism and regulation is mediated by a large number of enzymes, proteins and second messengers. There appears to be a core pathway common to all sphingolipid-producing organisms but recent studies have begun to dissect out important, species-specific differences. Many of these have only recently been discovered and in most cases the molecular and biochemical details are only beginning to emerge. Where there is a direct link from classic biochemistry to clinical symptoms, a number a drug companies have undertaken a medicinal chemistry campaign to try to deliver a therapeutic intervention to alleviate a number of diseases. Where appropriate, we highlight targets where natural products have been exploited as useful tools. Taking all these aspects into account this review covers the structural, mechanistic and regulatory features of sphingolipid biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes.},

A., et al. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 1227-1233]. The center of mass of the 2,2,3,4,4,6-D6 deuterated sites on the sterol label was found to reside 16 Å from the middle of the bilayer in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (16:0-18:1PC), 1,2- dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (18:1-18:1PC), and 1-stearoyl-2- arachidonylphosphatidylcholine (18:0-20:4PC). This location places cholesterol's hydroxyl group close to the membrane surface, indicative of the molecule in its commonly understood "upright" orientation. However, for dipolyunsaturated 20:4-20:4PC membranes the label, thus the hydroxyl group, was found sequestered in the center of the bilayer. We attributed the change in location to the high level of disorder of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that is incompatible with proximity to the rigid steroid moiety in its usual upright orientation. From that study, the unresolved question was whether the molecule was inverted or lying flat with respect to the membrane plane, in the middle of the bilayer. We have followed up those results with additional neutron experiments employing [25,26,26,26,27,27-D7]cholesterol, a deuterated analogue labeled in the tail. These diffraction measurements unequivocally show cholesterol lies flat in the middle of 20:4-20: 4PC bilayers. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Although there is evidence supporting the idea that LRRK2 has an immune function, the cellular function of this kinase is still largely unknown. By using genetic, pharmacological and proteomics approaches, we show that LRRK2 kinase activity negatively regulates phagosome maturation via the recruitment of the Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex and Rubicon to the phagosome in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity in mouse and human macrophages enhanced Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagosome maturation and mycobacterial control independently of autophagy. In vivo, LRRK2 deficiency in mice resulted in a significant decrease in M.~tuberculosis burdens early during the infection. Collectively, our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining genetic evidence linking LRRK2 to mycobacterial diseases and establish an LRRK2-dependent cellular pathway that controls M.~tuberculosis replication by regulating phagosome maturation.},

  abstract = {Maintenance of cellular homeostasis requires tight and coordinated control of numerous metabolic pathways, which are governed by interconnected networks of signaling pathways and energy-sensing regulators. Autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway by which the cell self-digests its own components, has over the past decade been recognized as an essential part of metabolism. Autophagy not only rids the cell of excessive or damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and invading microorganisms, it also provides nutrients to maintain crucial cellular functions. Besides serving as essential structural moieties of biomembranes, lipids including sphingolipids are increasingly being recognized as central regulators of a number of important cellular processes, including autophagy. In the present review we describe how sphingolipids, with special emphasis on ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate, can act as physiological regulators of autophagy in relation to cellular and organismal growth, survival, and aging.},

  abstract = {Non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections are often clinically challenging, with lengthy antibiotic regimens that fail to resolve the infections with few good outcomes remaining. Mycobacteriophages—viruses that infect Mycobacterium hosts—show promise as therapeutic agents for NTM infections and have been used in 20 compassionate use cases. Favorable outcomes were observed in many but not all cases, although the phages show exceptional safety profiles and no evidence of phage resistance was observed, even when only a single phage was administered. Phage-specific antibodies are commonly present following intravenous administration and are often neutralizing for the phage in vitro. However, phage neutralization does not consistently correlate with poor treatment outcomes and may not be a therapeutic limitation in all patients, even when immunocompetent. Currently, the therapeutic potential of phages is substantially limited by the great variation in phage susceptibility and a relatively small repertoire of therapeutically useful phages. As many as 45\% of clinical isolates can have a smooth colony morphotype, and phages that both efficiently infect and kill these strains have yet to be described. In contrast, \textasciitilde{} 75\% of rough strains are susceptible to and killed by one or more phages and therapeutic options can be considered on a compassionate use basis. Although therapies must currently be personalized, elucidating the determinants of phage host specificity, expanding the useful phage repertoire, and identifying the key determinants of clinical outcomes will reveal their full therapeutic potential.},

Gonococcal outer membrane proteins of the Opa family induce the opsonin-independent uptake of the bacteria that relies on CEACAM receptors and an active signaling machinery of the phagocyte. Here, we show that CEACAM receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Opa52-expressing N. gonorrhoeae into human cells results in a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase. Inhibition of this enzyme by imipramine or SR33557 abolishes opsonin-independent internalization without affecting bacterial adherence. Reconstitution of ceramide, the product of acid sphingomyelinase activity, in imipramine- or SR33557-treated cells restores internalization of the bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CEACAM receptor-initiated stimulation of other signalling molecules, in particular Src-like tyrosine kinases and Jun N-terminal kinases, requires acid sphingomyelinase. These studies provide evidence for a crucial role of the acid sphingomyelinase for CEACAM receptor-initiated signalling events and internalization of Opa52- expressing N. gonorrhoeae into human neutrophils.

  abstract = {We have carried out a detailed comparison of the motile properties of differentiated HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood neutrophils. We compared the effects of chemotactic stimuli and of inhibitors of signalling proteins on morphology, chemokinesis and chemotaxis of neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells using videomicroscopy and a filter assay for chemotaxis. We also assessed expression of signalling and cytoskeletal proteins using Western blotting. Chemotactic peptide induced a front-tail polarity in HL-60 cells comparable to that of neutrophils. Chemokinetic and chemotactic responses to chemotactic peptide were also very similar for both cell types, concerning mean speed of migration, the fraction of migrated cells and the concentration of stimulus optimal for activation. The cytokine interleukin-8 was in contrast clearly less effective in activating motile responses of differentiated HL-60 cells as compared to neutrophils. An important functional role of Rho-activated kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in motile responses of HL-60 cells, consistent with their upregulation during differentiation, could be confirmed using inhibitors with specificity for the corresponding enzymes. The only difference observed here between HL-60 cells and neutrophils concerned the differential effects of a protein kinase C inhibitor. In summary, the results presented here show that differentiated HL-60 cells, stimulated with chemotactic peptide, are a valid model system to study molecular mechanisms of neutrophil emigration. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Since the first description of mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) in 1997, enormous progress has been made in elucidating the role of TLRs in disease through combining in vitro cellular/molecular studies, in vivo animal studies, and human genetic population studies of the innate immune response. The family of mammalian TLRs plays a key role in innate immune responses to a wide range of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Further, variations in human susceptibility to infection are linked to polymorphisms in TLRs and components of TLR signaling pathways. Mammalian TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains consisting of multiple leucine-rich repeat structures that vary substantially between the receptors. The intracellular domains are more highly conserved and consist largely of a well-defined domain called the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain. TLRs are expressed widely, but the specific subsets expressed vary considerably between different tissues and cell types. TLRs are implicated in inflammatory responses to a wide range of microbial products. There is increasing evidence that TLRs directly bind the microbial products that they respond to. Genetic evidence strongly suggests that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binds to TLR4. Certain minimal LPS structures such as lipid IVa and Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A are antagonists for human cells, but agonists in mouse cells. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), persists worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Since membrane fusion between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells is essential for the early step of the infection, the membrane compositions, including sphingolipids, in host cells are considered to affect the viral infection. However, the role of sphingolipids in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Here, we assessed several inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism enzymes against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection in vitro. Among the compounds tested, only N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR, also known as fenretinide), an inhibitor of dihydroceramide Δ4-desaturase 1 (DES1) and well known for having antitumour activity, suppressed cell-cell fusion (50\% effective concentration [EC50] = 4.1 µM) and viral infection ([EC50] = 4.4 µM), wherein the EC50 values are below its plasma concentration in previous clinical trials on tumours. DES1 catalyses the introduction of a double bond in dihydroceramide, and the inhibition efficiencies observed were consistent with an increased ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to total sphingolipids and the decreased cellular membrane fluidity. These findings, together with the accumulated clinical data regarding the safety of 4-HPR, make it a likely candidate drug to treat COVID-19.},

Study quality was assessed by Newcastle‐Ottawa scale and we conducted a meta‐analysis using random‐effects models.                                                        Results                                Of 14 studies (eight cohort and six case–control studies) that involved 22~616~623 participants met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. There was substantial variation between studies in the estimates of the effect of                 DM                 on                 TB                 . However, the pooled estimates from seven high‐quality studies showed that diabetic people have a 1.5‐fold increased risk of developing active                 TB                 vs                 . those without                 DM                 (95\%                 CI                 1.28–1.76), with relatively small heterogeneity (                 I                 2                 ~=~44\%). The increased risk of                 TB                 was observed predominantly among                 DM                 populations with poor glycaemic control.                                                        Conclusion                                There is evidence suggesting an increased risk of developing                 TB                 among people with                 DM                 , and that improving glycaemic control in                 DM                 patients would reduce the risk of developing                 TB                 .

Méthodes               Revue systématique et méta‐analyse. Nous avons recherché dans la littérature des études qui rapportaient sur l'effet du DS sur la TB, ajusté pour l'effet de l’âge. Les études n'ayant pas effectué le diagnostic du DS avant la détection de la TB active ont été exclues. La qualité de l’étude a été évaluée selon l’échelle de Newcastle‐Ottawa et nous avons effectué une méta‐analyse à l'aide de modèles à effets aléatoires.                                         Résultats               14 études (8 études de cohorte et 6 études cas‐témoins) impliquant 22.616.623 participants répondaient aux critères de sélection et ont été incluses dans l'analyse. Il y avait une variation substantielle entre les études dans les estimations de l'effet du DS sur la TB. Cependant, les estimations poolées de 7 études de haute qualité ont montré que les personnes diabétiques avaient un risque 1,5 fois plus élevé de développer une TB active que celles sans DS (IC95\%: 1,28‐1,76), avec une hétérogénéité relativement faible (I2, 44\%). Le risque accru de TB a été observé principalement chez les populations de DM avec un faible contrôle de la glycémie.                                         Conclusion               Il existe des preuves suggérant un risque accru de développer une TB chez les personnes atteintes de DS et que l'amélioration du contrôle glycémique chez les patients atteints de DS réduirait le risque de développer la TB. Une approche intégrée est nécessaire pour lutter contre la double charge de morbidité du DS et de la TB.},

To accurately evaluate and optically measure this TfR targeting delivery in vitro, a CHO cell line with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged human TfR was established. A chimera of the hTfR and EGFP was engineered by fusing EGFP to the amino terminus of hTfR. Data were provided to demonstrate that hTfR-EGFP chimera was predominantly localized on the plasma membrane with some intracellular fluorescent structures on CHO cells and the EGFP moiety did not affect the endocytosis property of hTfR. Receptor internalization occurred similarly to that of HepG2 cells expressing wild-type hTfR. The internalization percentage of this chimeric receptor was about 81±3\% of wild type. Time-dependent co-localization of hTfR-EGFP and PE-conjugated anti-hTfR mAb in living cells demonstrated the trafficking of mAb-receptor complexes through the endosomes followed by segregation of part of the mAb and receptor at the late stages of endocytosis. The CHO-hTfR cells preferentially took up anti-hTfR mAb conjugated nanoparticles. This CHO-hTfR cell line makes it feasible for accurate evaluation and visualization of intracellular trafficking of therapeutic agents conjugated with transferrin or Abs targeting the hTfRs.},

To understand the role of ceramide during apoptosis and other cellular responses, it is critically important to characterize direct targets of ceramide action. In this paper, we show that ceramide specifically binds to and activates the endosomal acidic aspartate protease cathepsin D. Direct interaction of ceramide with cathepsin D results in autocatalytic proteolysis of the 52 kDa pre-pro cathepsin D to form the enzymatically active 48/32 kDa isoforms of cathepsin D. Acid sphingomyelinase (A-SMase)-deficient cells show decreased cathepsin D activity, which could be reconstituted by transfection with A-SMase cDNA. The results of our study identify cathepsin D as the first endosomal ceramide target that colocalizes with and may mediate downstream signaling effects of A-SMase.},

  abstract = {Several important pathogens cause disease by surviving and replicating within host cells. Bacterial proliferation is the product of both replication and killing undergone by the population. However, these processes are difficult to distinguish, and are usually assessed together by determination of net bacterial load. In addition, measurement of net load does not reveal heterogeneity within pathogen populations. This is particularly important in persistent infections in which slow or nongrowing bacteria are thought to have a major impact. Here we report the development of a reporter system based on fluorescence dilution that enables direct quantification of the replication dynamics of               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium (               S.

Typhimurium virulence determinant, the               Salmonella               pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system, is required for bacterial replication but does not have a major influence on resistance to killing. Furthermore, we found that, upon entry into macrophages, many bacteria do not replicate, but appear to enter a dormant-like state. These could represent an important reservoir of persistent bacteria. The approach could be extended to other pathogens to study the contribution of virulence and host resistance factors to replication and killing, and to identify and characterize nonreplicating bacteria associated with chronic or latent infections.},

In particular, the time course of cell morphology, of bead motion and of cortical tension were determined. Here, we introduce a number of mechanistic models for phagocytosis and test their validity by comparing the experimental data with finite element computations for multiple bead sizes. We find that the optimal models involve two key mechanical interactions: a repulsion or pressure between cytoskeleton and free membrane that drives protrusion, and an attraction between cytoskeleton and membrane newly adherent to the bead that flattens the cell into a thin lamella. Other models such as cytoskeletal expansion or swelling appear to be ruled out as main drivers of phagocytosis because of the characteristics of bead motion during engulfment. We finally show that the protrusive force necessary for the engulfment of large beads points towards storage of strain energy in the cytoskeleton over a large distance from the leading edge (∼0.5 μm), and that the flattening force can plausibly be generated by the known concentrations of unconventional myosins at the leading edge.},

However, the signals regulating the decision for repair or lysophagy are poorly characterised. Here, we show that the Parkinson's disease (PD)-related kinase LRRK2 is activated in macrophages by pathogen- or sterile-induced endomembrane damage. LRRK2 recruits the Rab GTPase Rab8A to damaged endolysosomes as well as the ESCRT-III component CHMP4B, thereby favouring ESCRT-mediated repair. Conversely, in the absence of LRRK2 and Rab8A, damaged endolysosomes are targeted to lysophagy. These observations are recapitulated in macrophages from PD patients where pathogenic LRRK2 gain-of-function mutations result in the accumulation of endolysosomes which are positive for the membrane damage marker Galectin-3. Altogether, this work indicates that LRRK2 regulates endolysosomal homeostasis by controlling the balance between membrane repair and organelle replacement, uncovering an unexpected function for LRRK2, and providing a new link between membrane damage and PD.},

Yet, fungus-associated helper bacteria of the genusMycetocola (Mycetocola tolaasinivorans and Mycetocola lacteus) may protect their host by an unknown detoxification mechanism. By a combination of metabolic profiling, imaging mass spectrometry, structure elucidation, and bioassays, we found that the helper bacteria inactivate tolaasin by linearizing the lipocyclopeptide. Furthermore, we found that Mycetocola spp. impair the dissemination of the pathogen by cleavage of the lactone ring of pseudodesmin. The role of pseudodesmin as a major swarming factor was corroborated by identification and inactivation of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Activity-guided fractionation of the Mycetocola proteome, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) analyses, and heterologous enzyme production identified the lactonase responsible for toxin cleavage. We revealed an antivirulence strategy in the context of a tripartite interaction that has high ecological and agricultural relevance.},

Although requiring tyrosine phosphorylation and the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like motif, uptake mediated by Dectin-1 was different from any previously reported phagocytic receptor and was not dependent on Syk-kinase in macrophages. Furthermore, intracellular trafficking of this receptor was influenced by the nature of the beta-glucan ligand, which has significance for the biologic activity of these immunomodulatory carbohydrates.},

  abstract = {© 2019, The Author(s). The intracellular transport of cholesterol is subject to tight regulation. The structure of the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2, also known as SCARB2) reveals a large cavity that traverses the molecule and resembles the cavity in SR-B1 that mediates lipid transfer. The detection of cholesterol within the LIMP-2 structure and the formation of cholesterol−like inclusions in LIMP-2 knockout mice suggested the possibility that LIMP2 transports cholesterol in lysosomes. We present results of molecular modeling, crosslinking studies, microscale thermophoresis and cell-based assays that support a role of LIMP-2 in cholesterol transport. We show that the cavity in the luminal domain of LIMP-2 can bind and deliver exogenous cholesterol to the lysosomal membrane and later to lipid droplets. Depletion of LIMP-2 alters SREBP-2-mediated cholesterol regulation, as well as LDL-receptor levels. Our data indicate that LIMP-2 operates in parallel with Niemann Pick (NPC)-proteins, mediating a slower mode of lysosomal cholesterol export.},

Despite normal Tcell numbers in the skin, Cxcr3-/- mice exhibited dramatically impaired CD8+-T-cell-dependent virus clearance. Intravital microscopy revealed that Cxcr3-/- Tcells were markedly deficient in locating, engaging, and killing virus-infected cells. Further, transfer of wild-type CD8+ Tcells restored viral clearance in Cxcr3-/- animals.

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of mare basalt ages are necessary to place constraints on the duration and the flux of lunar volcanism as well as on the petrogenesis of lunar mare basalts and their relationship to the thermal evolution of the Moon. We performed new crater size‐frequency distribution measurements in order to investigate the stratigraphy of mare basalts in Oceanus Procellarum and related regions such as Mare Nubium, Mare Cognitum, and Mare Insularum. We used high‐resolution Clementine color data to define 86 spectrally homogeneous units within these basins, which were then dated with crater counts on Lunar Orbiter IV images. Our crater size‐frequency distribution measurements define mineralogical and spectral surface units and offer significant improvements in accuracy over previous analyses. Our data show that volcanism in the investigated region was active over a long period of time from ∼3.93 to 1.2 b.y., a total of ∼2.7 b.y. Volumetrically, most of the basalts erupted in the Late Imbrian Period between ∼3.3 and 3.7 b.y., and we see evidence that numerous units have been resurfaced. During the Eratosthenian Period, significantly less basalt was erupted. Depending on the absolute model ages that one can assign to the lunar chronostratigraphic systems, five units might be of Copernican age. Younger basalts are generally exposed in the center of the investigated area, that is, closer to the volcanic centers of the Aristarchus Plateau and Marius Hills. Older basalts occur preferentially along the northwestern margin of Oceanus Procellarum and in the southeastern regions of the studied area, i.e., in Mare Cognitum and Mare Nubium. Combining the new data with our previously measured ages for basalts in Mare Imbrium, Serenitatis, Tranquillitatis, Humorum, Australe, and Humboldtianum, we find that the period of active volcanism on the Moon lasted ∼2.8 b.y., from ∼4 b.y. to ∼1.2 b.y. On the basis of the basalts dated so far, which do not yet include the potentially young basalts of Mare Smythii e.g.,all investigated basins but probably also is the location of some of the youngest basalts on the lunar surface.},

In human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), ceramide production correlates with and plays a role in the regulation of functional responses such as oxidant release and Fcgamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis. To increase our understanding of the sphingomyelin cycle in human PMNs, the cellular location of neutral and acid sphingomyelinases was investigated in resting, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP)-activated, and FMLP-activated PMNs engaged in phagocytosis. In resting PMNs, a Mg2+-dependent, neutral sphingomyelinase was the predominant activity and was localized to the plasma membrane fractions along with the majority of ceramide. Upon FMLP-activation, there was a 1. 9-fold increase in this neutral, Mg2+-dependent sphingomyelinase activity, which increased to 2.7-fold subsequent to phagocytosis of IgG opsonized targets. This increase in sphingomyelinase activity was restricted to the plasma membrane fractions, which were also the site of increased ceramide levels. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity, which is a target of ceramide action and is required for phagocytosis, was also found primarily in the plasma membrane fractions of FMLP-activated and phagocytosing PMNs. Our findings indicate that in human PMNs engaged in phagocytosis, the sphingomyelin cycle is restricted to the plasma membrane where intracellular targets of ceramide action, such as PLD, are localized.},

  abstract = {Fcgamma receptors are important mediators of the binding of IgG to and induction of phagocytosis in neutrophils. COS-1 cells provide a potentially useful model for studying these receptors because transfection with the FcgammaRIIA renders these cells phagocytic. During FcgammaRIIA-mediated phagocytosis in COS-1 cells, endogenous ceramide levels increased 52\% by 20 min (p {$<$} 0.01). Phospholipase D activity increased by 62\% (p {$<$} 0.01). Correspondingly, the phagocytic index increased by 3.7-fold by 20 min. Two inhibitors of ceramide formation were used to assess the consequences of reduced ceramide generation. l-Cycloserine, an inhibitor that blocks serine palmitoyltransferase activity, lowered both sphingosine and ceramide levels. Under these conditions, the phagocytic index increased 100\% in the presence of 2 mm l-cycloserine. The formation of ceramide resulting from the N-acylation of dihydrosphingosine or sphingosine by ceramide synthase is inhibited by the fungal toxin fumonisin B(1). When cells were treated with 5-50 microm fumonisin B(1), the cellular level of ceramide decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, while simultaneously the phagocytic index increased by 52\%. Concomitantly, three indirect measures of FcgammaRIIA activity were altered with the fall in ceramide levels. Syk phosphorylation, phospholipase D activity, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation were increased at 30 min. When Syk phosphorylation was blocked with piceatannol and cells were similarly challenged, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation was blocked, but no changes in either ceramide accumulation or MAP kinase activation were observed. Ceramide formation and MAP kinase activation are therefore not dependent on Syk kinase activity in this system. These results indicate that COS-1 cells provide a useful model for the recapitulation of sphingolipid signaling in the study of phagocytosis. Ceramide formed by de novo synthesis may represent an important mechanism in the regulation of phagocytosis.},

The past two decades have seen significant advances in sphingolipid research, and in 2010 a first sphingolipid receptor modulator was employed as a human therapeutic. Furthermore, cellular signaling mechanisms regulated by sphingolipids are being recognized as critical players in metabolic diseases. This review focuses on recent advances in cellular and physiological mechanisms of sphingolipid regulation and how sphingolipid signaling influences metabolic diseases. Progress in this area may contribute to new understanding and therapeutic options in complex diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

As a class with pleiotropic effects, recent efforts have centred on discerning specific ceramide species and their effects on atopic dermatitis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This delineation has allowed the identification of disease biomarkers, with long acyl chain ceramides such as C16- and C18-ceramides linked to metabolic dysfunction and cardiac function decline, while ultra-long acyl chain ceramides ({$>$}25 carbon acyl chain) were reported to be essential for maintaining a functional skin barrier. Given the intricate link between free fatty acids with ceramides, especially the de novo synthetic pathway, intracellular lipid droplet formation is increasingly viewed as an important mechanism for preventing accumulation of toxic ceramide species. Here, we review recent reports of various ceramide species involved in skin abnormalities and metabolic diseases, and we propose that promotion of lipid droplet biogenesis can be seen as a potential protective mechanism against deleterious ceramides.},

We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medications in patients with psychiatric disorders hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observational multicenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adult inpatients, 164 (30.1\%) received a FIASMA psychotropic medication upon hospital admission for COVID-19. We compared the composite endpoint of intubation or death between patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and other medications. FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline was significantly associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in both crude (HR\,=\,0.42; 95\%CI\,=\,0.31–0.57;               p               \,{$<$}\,0.01) and primary inverse probability weighting (IPW) (HR\,=\,0.50; 95\%CI\,=\,0.37–0.67;               p               \,{$<$}\,0.01) analyses. This association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. Patients taking a FIASMA antidepressant at baseline had a significantly reduced risk of intubation or death compared with those taking a non-FIASMA antidepressant at baseline in both crude (HR\,=\,0.57; 95\%CI\,=\,0.38–0.86;               p               \,{$<$}\,0.01) and primary IPW (HR\,=\,0.57; 95\%CI\,=\,0.37–0.87;               p               \,{$<$}\,0.01) analyses. These associations remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Our results show the potential importance of the ASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19 and support the continuation of FIASMA psychotropic medications in these patients and the need of large- scale clinical trials evaluating FIASMA medications, and particularly FIASMA antidepressants, against COVID-19.},

Although many receptors have been implicated in the clearance of apoptotic cells, the roles of these receptors in the engulfment process have not been well defined. We developed a novel system to distinguish between receptors involved in tethering of apoptotic cells versus those inducing their uptake. Our results suggest that regardless of the receptors engaged on the phagocyte, ingestion does not occur in the absence of phosphatidylserine (PS). Further, recognition of PS was found to be dependent on the presence of the PS receptor (PSR). Both PS and anti-PSR antibodies stimulated membrane ruffling, vesicle formation, and "bystander" uptake of cells bound to the surface of the phagocyte. We propose that the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells requires two events: tethering followed by PS-stimulated, PSR-mediated macropinocytosis.},

Hoffmann and coworkers show that SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the host cell factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor. These findings might help to establish options for prevention and treatment. SUMMARY The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important com-monalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.},

This photo-induced Sph-driven calcium release requires the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) residing on endosomes and lysosomes. Further, uncaging of Sph leads to the translocation of the autophagy-relevant transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus specifically after lysosomal calcium release. We confirm that Sph accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of cells derived from Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients and demonstrate a greatly reduced calcium release upon Sph uncaging. We conclude that sphingosine is a positive regulator of calcium release from acidic stores and that understanding the interplay between Sph homeostasis, calcium signaling and autophagy will be crucial in developing new therapies for lipid storage disorders such as NPC.},

The probes are equipped with two photoreactive groups to allow photoliberation (uncaging) and photo-cross-linking in a sequential manner, as well as a click-handle for subsequent functionalization. We demonstrate the versatility of the design for the signaling lipids sphingosine and diacylglycerol; uncaging of the probe for these two species triggered calcium signaling and intracellular protein translocation events, respectively. We performed proteomic screens to map the lipid-interacting proteome for both lipids. Finally, we visualized a sphingosine transport deficiency in patient-derived Niemann-Pick disease type C fibroblasts by fluorescence as well as correlative light and electron microscopy, pointing toward the diagnostic potential of such tools.

Moreover, inhibition of ceramide synthesis markedly improves glucose tolerance and prevents the onset of frank diabetes in obese rodents. Collectively, these data have two important implications. First, they indicate that different fatty acids induce insulin resistance by distinct mechanisms discerned by their reliance on sphingolipid synthesis.

A specific enzyme, sphingomyelinase can convert this lipid to ceramide, a central second messenger in cellular signaling for apoptosis (programmed cell death), differentiation, and senescence. We used microinjection and either Hoffman modulation contrast or fluorescence microscopy of giant liposomes composed of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC), N- palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (C16: 0-SM), and Bodipy-sphingomyelin as a fluorescent tracer (molar ratio 0.75:0.20:0.05, respectively) to observe changes in lipid lateral distribution and membrane morphology upon formation of ceramide. Notably, in addition to rapid domain formation (capping), vectorial budding of vesicles, i.e., endocytosis and shedding, can be induced by the asymmetrical sphingomyelinase-catalyzed generation of ceramide in either the outer or the inner leaflet, respectively, of giant phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin liposomes. These results are readily explained by 1) the lateral phase separation of ceramide enriched domains, 2) the area difference between the adjacent monolayers, 3) the negative spontaneous curvature and 4) the augmented bending rigidity of the ceramide- containing domains, leading to membrane invagination and vesiculation of the bilayer.},

  abstract = {T he propensity of the non-polar acyl chains of lipids to self-associate in water is the physical basis for spontaneous membrane formation, and renders membranes virtually impermeable to polar solutes. This fundamental principle enabled the first cells to segregate their internal constituents from the external environment and is repeated within nucleated cells to form discrete organelles. Whereas a single lipid species is sufficient to generate a barrier to unregulated solute movement, membrane lipids in eukaryotic cells are characterized by a remarkable structural diversity 1,2. In addition, the lipid composition and transbilayer arrangement among organelles show striking variations, and there is compelling evidence that the collective properties of the bulk lipids play a profound part in defining organelle identity and function. Of particular interest are the lipid-induced changes in physical membrane properties such as bilayer thickness, lipid packing density and surface charge that mark the transition from early to late orga-nelles in the secretory pathway 3,4. These alterations are conserved from yeast to human and provide specific cues for membrane proteins to allow temporal and spatial control over the molecular events that govern secretion. This requires not only elaborate metabolic machinery for creating a diverse repertoire of membrane lipids, but also ways to preserve the unique lipid mixtures of early and late secretory orga-nelles. Without mechanisms imposing selectivity and directionality on lipid movement, organelle identity and function would vanish in the face of extensive vesicular trafficking. In this Review, we discuss how cells coordinate lipid metabolism and transport to achieve membrane lipid homeostasis in organelles connected by vesicular trafficking. As the underlying molecular principles involve collective phenomena beyond specific interactions among proteins and lipids, we first describe how lipid composition influences the generic physical properties of the membrane and how these properties change from early to late secretory organelles. We discuss how these changes are monitored by membrane sensors that relay signals to the lipid metabolic machinery when organellar lipid homeostasis is challenged. We then focus on the long-standing enigma that lipid traffic in cells is largely independent of membrane traffic. Current models suggest that lipid traffic is mediated by cytoplasmic transfer proteins that operate at contact sites between early and late secretory organelles. An appealing concept is that these so-called lipid pipelines 5 are exploited to bypass vesicular connections for optimal control over lipid exchange between secretory organelles. Finally, we discuss mounting evidence of extensive co-regulation among individual lipid classes and how perturbation of the underlying homeostatic machinery can culminate in system failure and disease. Lipid repertoire of the secretory pathway The organelles along the secretory pathway have major differences in lipid composition that help to shape their specialized tasks. Whereas some rare lipids (for example, phosphoinositides) contribute to orga-nelle identity by mediating specific molecular recognition events, we focus on how the collective action of the bulk lipids specify orga-nelle function by influencing generic physical membrane parameters such as fluidity, thickness, lipid packing density and surface charge (Fig. 1a). For proper organelle function, these parameters must be kept within an appropriate range. To better understand the underlying principles, we first discuss some physico-chemical properties of the main categories of membrane lipids found along the secretory pathway-phospholipids, sphingolipids and sterols. Phospholipids constitute the bulk of the membrane's lipid matrix. They contain two hydrophobic acyl chains and a phosphate head group ester linked to a glycerol backbone. Further classification is based on the structure of the phospholipid head group, which is zwitterionic in phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidyle-thanolamine (PtdEtn), or anionic in phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). Each phospholipid class comprises a multitude of molecular species defined by the length and degree of saturation in their acyl chains. Both head group and acyl chain composition influence the physical properties of the membrane 6. PtdCho accounts for more than 50\% of all phospholipids in most eukaryotes and usually contains one cis-unsaturated acyl chain, such as oleic acid (C18:1). The rigid kink of the cis-double bond lowers the packing density of the acyl chains, which increases membrane fluidity 7. Facilitated by its cylindrical shape, PtdCho self-assembles spontaneously into closed bilayers that adopt a liquid crystalline state at physiological temperature. Thus, PtdCho is ideally suited to providing a stable and fluid matrix for cellular membranes, a precondition for the living state. By contrast, PtdEtn is a conically shaped phospholipid that imposes negative curvature stress on the membrane owing to its relatively small polar head group. The non-bilayer propensity of PtdEtn increases with acyl chain unsaturation, creating lipid-packing The lipid composition of cellular organelles is tailored to suit their specialized tasks. A fundamental transition in the lipid landscape divides the secretory pathway in early and late membrane territories, allowing an adaptation from biogenic to barrier functions. Defending the contrasting features of these territories against erosion by vesicular traffic poses a major logistical problem.

We review recent insights into the molecular basis of this regulatory network and consider examples in which malfunction of its components leads to system failure and disease.},

The resulting preparations were more than 95\% pure and contained less than 0.1\% native IgG. Purified C3b and iC3b were coupled to latex beads (0.8 μm diameter) by means of F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibodies against the β chain or the C3d region of C3, thus orienting the C3b and the iC3b on the latex with the C3b- and iC3b-specific regions outwards. These particles were found to activate the respiratory burst of freshly isolated human neutrophils to 20-30\% of the maximal capacity. Latex particles randomly coated with C3b or iC3b were about 3 times less stimulatory. C3b, iC3b and IgG coupled to latex in an oriented fashion were about equally effective in stimulating the respiratory burst. Neutrophils from a patient with a total deficiency of CR3 responded normally to C3b-coated latex but did not respond to iC3b-coated latex. A monoclonal antibody against the a chain of CR3 inhibited the activation by iC3b-coated latex and a polyclonal antibody against CR1 partially inhibited the activation by C3b-coated latex. We found an additive effect between IgG-coated latex and C3b-coated latex, regardless of the presence of IgG and C3b on the same particle or on different particles. Thus, binding of ligands to either CR1 or CR3 per se is sufficient to induce an activating signal to the NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils. © 1990.},

  abstract = {The small G proteins Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 regulate the rearrangements of actin and membrane necessary for Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages. Activated, GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 bind to the p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK1, and this interaction provided a basis for microscopic methods to localize activation of these G proteins inside cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based stoichiometry of fluorescent chimeras of actin, PBD, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 was used to quantify G protein activation relative to actin movements during phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes. The activation dynamics of endogenous G proteins, localized using yellow fluorescent protein-labeled PBD, was restricted to phagocytic cups, with a prominent spike of activation over an actin-poor region at the base of the cup. Refinements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer stoichiometry allowed calculation of the fractions of activated GTPases in forming phagosomes. Cdc42 activation was restricted to the leading margin of the cell, whereas Rac1 was active throughout the phagocytic cup. During phagosome closure, activation of Rac1 and Rac2 increased uniformly and transiently in the actin-poor region of phagosomal membrane. These distinct roles for Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 in the component activities of phagocytosis indicate mechanisms by which their differential regulation coordinates rearrangements of actin and membranes.}

  abstract = {Tuberculosis, an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major cause of human death worldwide. Innate immunity provides host defense against Mtb. Phagocytosis, characterized by recognition of Mtb by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), is the first step of the innate immune defense mechanism. The recognition of Mtb is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), expressed on innate immune cells, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), complement receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain like receptors, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), mannose receptors, CD14 receptors, scavenger receptors, and FC γ receptors. Interaction of mycobacterial ligands with PRRs leads macrophages and DCs to secrete selected cytokines, which in turn induce interferon- γ - (IFN γ -) dominated immunity. IFN γ and other cytokines like tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF α ) regulate mycobacterial growth, granuloma formation, and initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mtb and finally provide protection to the host. However, Mtb can evade destruction by antimicrobial defense mechanisms of the innate immune system as some components of the system may promote survival of the bacteria in these cells and facilitate pathogenesis. Thus, although innate immunity components generally play a protective role against Mtb, they may also facilitate Mtb survival. The involvement of selected PRRs and cytokines on these seemingly contradictory roles is discussed.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol can be a major carbon source for Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection, both at an early stage in the macrophage phagosome and later within the necrotic granuloma. KstR is a highly conserved TetR family transcriptional repressor that regulates a large set of genes responsible for cholesterol catabolism. Many genes in this regulon, including kstR, are either induced during infection or are essential for survival of M. tuberculosis in vivo. In this study, we identified two ligands for KstR, both of which are CoA thioester cholesterol metabolites with four intact steroid rings.Ametabolite in which one of the rings was cleaved was not a ligand.Weconfirmed the ligand-protein interactions using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and showed that ligand binding strongly inhibited KstR-DNA binding using surface plasmon resonance (IC50 for ligand 25 nM). Crystal structures of the ligandfree form of KstR show variability in the position of the DNA-binding domain. In contrast, structures of KstRligand complexes are highly similar to each other and demonstrate a position of the DNA-binding domain that is unfavorable for DNA binding. Comparison of ligand-bound and ligand-free structures identifies residues involved in ligand specificity and reveals a distinctive mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change mediates DNA release.},

  abstract = {Background: The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as “one-third” of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. Methods and Findings: We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4\%–26.4\%), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80\% of those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8\% (95\% UI: 0.7\%–0.9\%) of the global population, amounting to 55.5 (95\% UI: 48.2–63.8) million individuals currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9\% (95\% UI:10.2\%–11.8\%) was isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. Conclusions: We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.},

  abstract = {Infection with filarial nematodes produces a chronic, long-lasting illness with adult worms able to survive within human hosts for up to 15 years. A contributor to the longevity of these parasites is the presence of phosphorylcholine (PC) on components of the worms' molecular secretions (ES). PC on ES modulates host immune responses towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype thereby generating an environment favourable for parasite survival. PC is attached to nematode ES via a covalent association with carbohydrate, which, although well-documented in bacteria and fungi, is absent from humans, making it an ideal target for the development of novel drugs. In order to produce such drugs it is first necessary to understand the structure and synthesis of nematode PC-glycans. ES-62 is the major PC-ES-product of Acanthocheilonema viteae and is a homologue of PC-ES found in human filarial nematodes. We have studied the structure and biosynthesis of PC-glycans of ES-62 by a combination of pulse-chase experiments, experiments involving the use of inhibitors of each of intracellular trafficking, oligosaccharide processing and phospholipid biosynthesis and various forms of mass spectrometry. Our indications indicate that PC is transferred in the lumen of the medial Golgi to an N-type glycan consisting of a trimannosyl core with or without core fucosylation bearing between 1 and 4 N-acetyl glucosamine residues. The structure of the PC-N-glycans found in ES-62 appears to be conserved amongst filarial nematodes in that it has additionally been identified in Onchocerca volvulus and O. gibsoni . Also, similar structures have been found in non-filarial parasitic nematodes and in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . Finally, PC has also been recently found attached to the carbohydrate moieties of nematode glycosphingolipids and the structure of these will also be considered.}

  abstract = {Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, despite the availability of effective chemotherapy and a vaccine. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), the tuberculosis vaccine, is an attenuated mutant of               Mycobacterium bovis               that was isolated after serial subcultures, yet the functional basis for this attenuation has never been elucidated. A single region (               RD1               ), which is absent in all BCG substrains, was deleted from virulent               M. bovis               and               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               strains, and the resulting Δ               RD1               mutants were significantly attenuated for virulence in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. The               M. tuberculosis               Δ               RD1               mutants were also shown to protect mice against aerosol challenge, in a similar manner to BCG. Interestingly, the Δ               RD1               mutants failed to cause cytolysis of pneumocytes, a phenotype that had been previously used to distinguish virulent               M. tuberculosis               from BCG. A specific transposon mutation, which disrupts the               Rv3874 Rv3875               (               cfp-10 esat-6               ) operon of               RD1               , also caused loss of the cytolytic phenotype in both pneumocytes and macrophages. This mutation resulted in the attenuation of virulence in mice, as the result of reduced tissue invasiveness. Moreover, specific deletion of each transcriptional unit of               RD1               revealed that three independent transcriptional units are required for virulence, two of which are involved in the secretion of ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target). We conclude that the primary attenuating mechanism of bacillus Calmette–Guérin is the loss of cytolytic activity mediated by secreted ESAT-6, which results in reduced tissue invasiveness.},

  abstract = {To understand how infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is modulated by host cell phenotype, we characterized those host phagocytes that controlled or supported bacterial growth during early infection, focusing on the ontologically distinct alveolar macrophage (AM) and interstitial macrophage (IM) lineages. Using fluorescent Mtb reporter strains, we found that bacilli in AM exhibited lower stress and higher bacterial replication than those in IM. Interestingly, depletion of AM reduced bacterial burden, whereas depletion of IM increased bacterial burden. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IMs were glycolytically active, whereas AMs were committed to fatty acid oxidation. Intoxication of infected mice with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose, decreased the number of IMs yet increased the bacterial burden in the lung. Furthermore, in in vitro macrophage infections, 2-deoxyglucose treatment increased bacterial growth, whereas the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir constrained bacterial growth. We hypothesize that different macrophage lineages respond divergently to Mtb infection, with IMs exhibiting nutritional restriction and controlling bacterial growth and AMs representing a more nutritionally permissive environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential expression, and the quantification of measurement error. In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic Δh whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Δh with the log-ratio.

  abstract = {The endosomal-lysosomal system is made up of a set of intracellular membranous compartments that dynamically interconvert, which is comprised of early endosomes, recycling endosomes, late endosomes, and the lysosome. In addition, autophagosomes execute autophagy, which delivers intracellular contents to the lysosome. Maturation of endosomes and/or autophagosomes into a lysosome creates an unique acidic environment within the cell for proteolysis and recycling of unneeded cellular components into usable amino acids and other biomolecular building blocks. In the endocytic pathway, gradual maturation of endosomes into a lysosome and acidification of the late endosome are accompanied by vesicle trafficking, protein sorting and targeted degradation of some sorted cargo. Two opposing sorting systems are operating in these processes: the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) supports targeted degradation and the retromer supports retrograde retrieval of certain cargo. The endosomal-lysosomal system is emerging as a central player in a host of neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating potential roles which are likely to be revealed in pathogenesis and for viable therapeutic strategies. Here we focus on the physiological process of endosomal-lysosomal maturation, acidification and sorting systems along the endocytic pathway, and further discuss relationships between abnormalities in the endosomal-lysosomal system and neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of animal plasma membranes. Its production involves the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide, yielding diacylglycerol as a side product. This reaction is catalysed by SM synthase, an enzyme whose biological potential can be judged from the roles of diacylglycerol and ceramide as anti- and proapoptotic stimuli, respectively. SM synthesis occurs in the lumen of the Golgi as well as on the cell surface. As no gene for SM synthase has been cloned so far, it is unclear whether different enzymes are present at these locations. Using a functional cloning strategy in yeast, we identified a novel family of integral membrane proteins exhibiting all enzymatic features previously attributed to animal SM synthase. Strikingly, human, mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes each contain at least two different SM synthase (SMS) genes. Whereas human SMS1 is localised to the Golgi, SMS2 resides primarily at the plasma membrane. Collectively, these findings open up important new avenues for studying sphingolipid function in animals.},

The proteomes of 137 and 634 proteins, respectively, are highly specific and highlight 94 potentially novel mitochondrial or ER proteins. Dataset intersection identified protein candidates potentially localized to mitochondria-ER contact sites. We found that one candidate, the tail-anchored, PDZ-domain-containing OMM protein SYNJ2BP, dramatically increases mitochondrial contacts with rough ER when overexpressed. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry identified ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) as SYNJ2BP’s ERM binding partner.

  abstract = {V-ATPases constitute a ubiquitous family of heteromultimeric, proton translocating proteins. According to their localization in a multitude of eukaryotic endomembranes and plasma membranes, they energize many different transport processes. Currently, a handful of specific inhibitors of the V-ATPase are known, which represent valuable tools for the characterization of transport processes on the level of tissues, single cells or even purified proteins. The understanding of how these inhibitors function may provide a basis to develop new drugs for the benefit of patients suffering from diseases such as osteoporosis or cancer. For this purpose, it appears absolutely essential to determine the exact inhibitor binding site in a target protein on the one side and to uncover the crucial structural elements of an inhibitor on the other side. However, even for some of the most popular and long known V-ATPase inhibitors, such as bafilomycin or concanamycin, the authentic structures of their binding sites are elusive. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent advances for the old players in the inhibition game, the plecomacrolides bafilomycin and concanamycin, and to introduce some of the new players, the macrolacton archazolid, the benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide, apicularen, oximidine and cruentaren, and the indolyls.},

Neurotropic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), also rely on cellular AKT-mTORC1 signaling to achieve viral latency. Here, we define a novel genotoxic response whereby spatially separated signals initiated by extracellular neurotrophic factors and nuclear DNA damage are integrated by the AKT-mTORC1 pathway. We demonstrate that endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by Topoisomerase 2β-DNA cleavage complex (TOP2βcc) intermediates are required to achieve AKT-mTORC1 signaling and maintain HSV-1 latency in neurons. Suppression of host DNA-repair pathways that remove TOP2βcc trigger HSV-1 reactivation. Moreover, perturbation of AKT phosphorylation dynamics by downregulating the PHLPP1 phosphatase led to AKT mis-localization and disruption of DSB-induced HSV-1 reactivation. Thus, the cellular genome integrity and environmental inputs are consolidated and co-opted by a latent virus to balance lifelong infection with transmission.},

  abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

  abstract = {Fungi and mammals share a co-evolutionary history and are involved in a complex web of interactions. Studies focused on commensal bacteria suggest that pathological changes in the microbiota, historically known as dysbiosis, are at the root of many inflammatory diseases of non-infectious origin. However, the importance of dysbiosis in the fungal community - the mycobiota - was only recently acknowledged to have a pathological role, as novel findings have suggested that mycobiota disruption can have detrimental effects on host immunity. Fungal dysbiosis and homeostasis are dynamic processes that are probably more common than actual fungal infections, and therefore constantly shape the immune response. In this Review, we summarize specific mycobiota patterns that are associated with fungal dysbiosis, and discuss how mucosal immunity has evolved to distinguish fungal infections from dysbiosis and how it responds to these different conditions. We propose that gut microbiota dysbiosis is a collective feature of complex interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities that can affect immunity and that can influence health and disease.},

The global alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was also re-estimated.             Systematic searches were conducted, reference lists were reviewed and expert consultations were held to identify studies. Cohort and case-control studies were included if there were no temporal violations of exposure and outcome. Risk relations (RRs) were pooled by using categorical and dose-response meta-analyses. The alcohol-attributable tuberculosis burden of disease was estimated by using alcohol-attributable fractions.                            36 of 1108 studies were included. RRs for alcohol use and alcohol-related problems were 1.35 (95\% CI 1.09–1.68; I               2               : 83\%) and 3.33 (95\% CI 2.14–5.19; 87\%), respectively. Concerning alcohol dosage, tuberculosis risk rose as ethanol intake increased, with evidence of a threshold effect. Alcohol consumption caused 22.02 incident cases (95\% CI 19.70–40.77) and 2.35 deaths (95\% CI 2.05–4.79) per 100{$\mkern1mu$}000 people from tuberculosis in 2014. Alcohol-attributable tuberculosis incidence increased between 2000 and 2014 in most high tuberculosis burden countries, whereas mortality decreased.                          Alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis in all meta-analyses. It was consequently a major contributor to the tuberculosis burden of disease.},

  abstract = {Cells employ regulated transport mechanisms to ensure that their plasma membranes (PMs) are optimally supplied with cholesterol derived from uptake of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and synthesis. To date, all inhibitors of cholesterol transport block steps in lysosomes, limiting our understanding of post-lysosomal transport steps. Here, we establish the cholesterol-binding domain 4 of anthrolysin O (ALOD4) as a reversible inhibitor of cholesterol transport from PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using ALOD4, we: (1) deplete ER cholesterol without altering PM or overall cellular cholesterol levels; (2) demonstrate that LDL-derived cholesterol travels from lysosomes first to PM to meet cholesterol needs, and subsequently from PM to regulatory domains of ER to suppress activation of SREBPs, halting cholesterol uptake and synthesis; and (3) determine that continuous PM-to-ER cholesterol transport allows ER to constantly monitor PM cholesterol levels, and respond rapidly to small declines in cellular cholesterol by activating SREBPs, increasing cholesterol uptake and synthesis.Cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane made mostly from oily molecules known as lipids. One of these lipids, called cholesterol, is essential for keeping this membrane stable. Cholesterol is partly produced within the cells at a specialized structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, and partly imported from the blood surrounding the cell. In the blood, cholesterol is shielded inside particles called low-density lipoprotein (or LDL for short), which is taken into the cell and then sent to another structure called the lysosome.Inside the cell, cholesterol that is freshly produced in the endoplasmic reticulum or freshly imported into the lysosome, must be moved to the plasma membrane, where most of the cholesterol is located. Cholesterol levels are regulated by a ‘control machinery’ of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. To keep the cholesterol levels constant, the endoplasmic reticulum needs to be in continual communication with the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms by which cholesterol is transported between membranes are still poorly understood. Here, Infante and Radhakrishnan report a new tool to study how cholesterol is transported in human and hamster cells. The tool, which is based on part of a bacterial protein, traps cholesterol in the plasma membrane and prevents it from moving to the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus from updating the control machinery about cholesterol levels.From this inhibition, it is inferred that a stream of cholesterol constantly travels from the plasma membrane back to endoplasmic reticulum. This way, proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can monitor the cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane in real-time. The endoplasmic reticulum responded rapidly even to small declines in cholesterol levels by activating genes that increase cholesterol production or the amount of cholesterol imported via the LDL pathway. Further work showed that cholesterol derived from LDL travels from the lysosome directly to the plasma membrane to maintain optimal cholesterol levels. It then moves to the endoplasmic reticulum to signal that cholesterol levels in the cell have been satisfied.The findings and tools described in this study will help to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the transport of cholesterol between the different membranes and structures in a cell. A next step will be to see if the mechanisms that apply to distribution of imported cholesterol from lysosomes, also apply to the cholesterol produced in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

  abstract = {Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.},

Trehalose-6,6′-dimycolate (TDM; also called cord factor) is a mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid that is the most studied immunostimulatory component of M. tuberculosis. Despite five decades of research on TDM, its host receptor has not been clearly identified. Here, we demonstrate that macrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) is an essential receptor for TDM. Heat-killed mycobacteria activated Mincle-expressing cells, but the activity was lost upon delipidation of the bacteria; analysis of the lipid extracts identified TDM as a Mincle ligand. TDM activated macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which are completely suppressed in Mincle-deficient macrophages. In vivo TDM administration induced a robust elevation of inflammatory cytokines in sera and characteristic lung inflammation, such as granuloma formation. However, no TDM-induced lung granuloma was formed in Mincle-deficient mice. Whole mycobacteria were able to activate macrophages even in MyD88-deficient background, but the activation was significantly diminished in Mincle/MyD88 double-deficient macrophages. These results demonstrate that Mincle is an essential receptor for the mycobacterial glycolipid, TDM.},

Treatment of neutrophils with anti-LacCer antibody, T5A7 or Huly-m13, induced superoxide generation from the cells, which was blocked by PP1, a Src kinase inhibitor; wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor; SB203580, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor; and H7, an inhibitor for protein kinase C. When promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were differentiated into neutrophilic lineage by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment, they acquired superoxide-generating activity but did not respond to anti-LacCer antibodies. Density gradient centrifugation revealed that LacCer and Lyn were recovered in detergent-insoluble membrane (DIM) of neutrophils and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. However, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that LacCer was associated with Lyn in neutrophils but not in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. Interestingly, T5A7 induced the phosphorylation of Lyn in neutrophils but not in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. Moreover, T5A7 induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in neutrophils. T5A7-induced Lyn phosphorylation in neutrophil DIM fraction was significantly enhanced by cholesterol depletion or sequestration with methyl-??-cyclodextrin or nystatin. Collectively, these data suggest that neutrophils are characterized by the presence of cell surface LacCer-enriched glycosphingolipid signaling domain coupled with Lyn and that the ligand binding to LacCer induces the activation of Lyn, which may be suppressibly regulated by cholesterol, leading to superoxide generation through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-, p38 MAPK-, and protein kinase C-dependent signal transduction pathway. ?? 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

However, HIV-1 spread is strongly enhanced in clusters of DCs and CD4+ T cells. Uninfected DCs capture HIV-1 and mediate viral transfer to bystander CD4+ T cells through a process termed trans-infection. Initial studies identified the C-type lectin DC-SIGN as the HIV-1 binding factor on DCs, which interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins. Upon DC maturation, however, DC-SIGN is down-regulated, while HIV-1 capture and trans-infection is strongly enhanced via a glycoprotein-independent capture pathway that recognizes sialyllactose-containing membrane gangliosides. Here we show that the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (Siglec-1, CD169), which is highly expressed on mature DCs, specifically binds HIV-1 and vesicles carrying sialyllactose. Furthermore, Siglec-1 is essential for trans-infection by mature DCs. These findings identify Siglec-1 as a key factor for HIV-1 spread via infectious DC/T-cell synapses, highlighting a novel mechanism that mediates HIV-1 dissemination in activated tissues. © 2012 Izquierdo-Useros et al.},

The pathways regulated by PI3‐kinases are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and thus must be tightly regulated.

One family member, Vps34, is of particular interest because it is the only PI3‐kinase identified in yeast and it has been evolutionarily conserved through mammals. Vps34 plays an essential role in the cellular process of autophagy, a process linked to human health and disease.

Neutrophils were loaded with the fluorescent dye fura2/AM and [Ca2+](i) was assessed by dual excitation microfluorimetry. Discharge of lactoferrin, a secondary granule marker into the phagosome was verified by immunostaining using standard epifluorescence, confocal laser scanning and electron microscopy. In Ca2+-containing medium, upon contact with a yeast particle, a rapid rise in [Ca2+](i) was observed, followed by one or more Ca2+ peaks (maximal value 1,586 nM and median duration 145 s): P-L fusion was detected in 80\% of the cells after 5-10 min. In Ca2+-free medium the amplitude, frequency and duration of the [Ca2+](i) transients were decreased (maximal value 368 nM, mostly one single Ca2+ peak and median duration 75 s): P-L fusion was decreased to 52\%. Increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ buffering capacity by loading the cells with MAPT/AM led to a dose-dependent inhibition both of [Ca2+](i) elevations and P-L fusion. Under conditions where basal [Ca2+](i) was reduced to {$<$}20 nM and intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted, P-L fusion was drastically inhibited while the cells ingested yeast particles normally. P-L fusion could be restored in Ca2+-buffered cells containing ingested particles by elevating [Ca2+](i) with the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin. The present findings directly indicate that although the ingestion step of phagocytosis is a Ca2+-independent event, [Ca2+](i) transients triggered upon contact with opsonized particles are necessary to control the subsequent fusion or secondary granules with the phagosomal membrane.},

These lipids must cross the outer membrane to support mitochondrial function, but how they do this is unclear. We identify the Voltage~Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC), an abundant outer membrane protein, as a scramblase-type lipid transporter that catalyzes lipid entry. On reconstitution into membrane vesicles, dimers of human VDAC1 and VDAC2 catalyze rapid transbilayer translocation of phospholipids by a mechanism that is unrelated to their channel activity. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of VDAC1 reveal that lipid scrambling occurs at a specific dimer interface where polar residues induce large water defects and bilayer thinning. The rate of phospholipid import into yeast mitochondria is an order of magnitude lower in the absence of VDAC homologs, indicating that VDACs provide the main pathway for lipid entry. Thus, VDAC isoforms, members of a superfamily of beta barrel proteins, moonlight as a class of phospholipid scramblases - distinct from alpha-helical scramblase proteins - that act to import lipids into mitochondria.},

Consistent with this view, increased levels of MMCoA led to increased abundance and mass of both PDIM and SL-1. Furthermore, perturbation of MMCoA metabolism attenuated pathogen replication in mice.

Instead, through a mechanism involving activation of host cytosolic phospholipase A 2, these bacteria rapidly escaped from phagosomes, and established residence in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Interestingly, by facilitating an enhanced suppression of host cellular autophagy, this translocation served as an alternate virulence acquisition mechanism.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogenic bacterium               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb), is a global health threat. Targeting host pathways that modulate protective or harmful components of inflammation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy that could aid sterilization or mitigate TB-associated permanent tissue damage. In purified form, many Mtb components can activate innate immune pathways. However, knowledge of the pathways that contribute most to the observed response to live Mtb is incomplete, limiting the possibility of precise intervention. We took a systematic, unbiased approach to define the pathways that drive the earliest immune response to Mtb. Using a macrophage model of infection, we compared the bulk transcriptional response to infection with the response to a panel of Mtb-derived putative innate immune ligands. We identified two axes of response: an NF-kB-dependent response similarly elicited by all Mtb pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and a type I interferon axis unique to cells infected with live Mtb. Consistent with growing literature data pointing to TLR2 as a dominant Mtb-associated PAMP, the TLR2 ligand PIM6 most closely approximated the NF-kB-dependent response to the intact bacterium. Quantitatively, the macrophage response to Mtb was slower and weaker than the response to purified PIM6. On a subpopulation level, the TLR2-dependent response was heterogeneously induced, with only a subset of infected cells expressing key inflammatory genes known to contribute to the control of infection. Despite potential redundancies in Mtb ligand/innate immune receptor interactions during               in vivo               infection, loss of the TLR2/PIM6 interaction impacted the cellular composition of both the innate and adaptive compartments.                                         IMPORTANCE                                Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. Drug resistance is outpacing new antibiotic discovery, and even after successful treatment, individuals are often left with permanent lung damage from the negative consequences of inflammation. Targeting host inflammatory pathways has been proposed as an approach that could either improve sterilization or improve post-treatment lung health. However, our understanding of the inflammatory pathways triggered by                 Mycobacterium tuberculosis                 (Mtb) in infected cells and lungs is incomplete, in part because of the complex array of potential molecular interactions between bacterium and host.

Drug resistance is outpacing new antibiotic discovery, and even after successful treatment, individuals are often left with permanent lung damage from the negative consequences of inflammation. Targeting host inflammatory pathways has been proposed as an approach that could either improve sterilization or improve post-treatment lung health. However, our understanding of the inflammatory pathways triggered by               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) in infected cells and lungs is incomplete, in part because of the complex array of potential molecular interactions between bacterium and host. Here, we take an unbiased approach to identify the pathways most central to the host response to Mtb. We examine how individual pathways are triggered differently by purified Mtb products or infection with the live bacterium and consider how these pathways inform the emergence of subpopulation responses in cell culture and in infected mice.

  abstract = {Pathogenic mycobacteria survive within macrophages by avoiding lysosomal delivery, instead residing in mycobacterial phagosomes. Upon infection, the leukocyte-specific protein coronin 1 is actively recruited to mycobacterial phagosomes, where it blocks lysosomal delivery by an unknown mechanism. Analysis of macrophages from coronin 1-deficient mice showed that coronin 1 is dispensable for F-actin-dependent processes such as phagocytosis, motility, and membrane ruffling. However, upon mycobacterial infection, coronin 1 was required for activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria. In the absence of coronin 1, calcineurin activity did not occur, resulting in lysosomal delivery and killing of mycobacteria. Furthermore, blocking calcineurin activation with cyclosporin A or FK506 led to lysosomal delivery and intracellular mycobacterial killing. These results demonstrate a role for coronin 1 in activating Ca2+ dependent signaling processes in macrophages and reveal a function for calcineurin in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion upon mycobacterial infection. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to antagonize inflammasome activation. Here, Edwardsiella piscicida gene-defined transposon library screening for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in nlrc4−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) demonstrates that genes clustered in the bacterial arginine metabolism pathway participate in NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Blocking arginine uptake or putrescine export significantly relieves NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, indicating that this bacterium rewires its arginine metabolism network during infection. Moreover, intracellular E. piscicida recruits the host arginine importer (mCAT-1) and putrescine exporter (Oct-2) to bacterium-containing vacuoles, accompanied by reduced arginine and accumulated cytosolic spermine. Neutralizing E. piscicida-induced cytosolic spermine enhancement by spermine synthetase or extracellular spermine significantly alters NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, accumulated cytosolic spermine inhibits K+ efflux-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These data highlight the mechanism of bacterial gene-mediated arginine metabolism control for NLRP3 inflammasome evasion.},

Hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment led to Bax translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

Recent studies have revealed the intracellular signalling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to mycobacterial infection. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 have been implicated in host interactions with Mtb, the relationship between specific mycobacterial molecules and various signal transduction pathways is not well understood. This review will discuss recent studies indicating critical roles for mycobacteria and mycobacterial components in regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and related signal transduction pathways that govern the outcome of infection and antibacterial defence. To better understand the roles of infection-induced signalling cascades in molecular pathogenesis, future studies are needed to clarify mechanisms that integrate the multiple signalling pathways that are activated by engagement of TLRs by both individual mycobacterial molecules and whole mycobacteria. These efforts will allow for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for tuberculosis that targets the intracellular signalling pathways permitting the replication of this nefarious pathogen.},

Previous studies have shown that membrane curvatures directly affect protein functions and intracellular signaling. However, few methods are able to precisely manipulate membrane curvature in live cells. Here, we report the development of a new method of generating nanoscale membrane curvature in live cells that is controllable, reversible, and capable of precise spatial and temporal manipulation. For this purpose, we make use of BAR domain proteins, a family of well-studied membrane-remodeling and membrane-sculpting proteins. Specifically, we engineered two optogenetic systems, opto-FBAR and opto-IBAR, that allow light-inducible formation of positive and negative membrane curvature respectively. Using opto-FBAR, blue light activation results in the formation of tubular membrane invaginations (positive curvature), controllable down to the subcellular level. Using opto-IBAR, blue light illumination results in the formation of membrane protrusions or filopodia (negative curvature). These systems present a novel approach for light-inducible manipulation of nanoscale membrane curvature in live cells.},

It is largely unclear how motor proteins are targeted specifically to different compartments. Rab GTPases recruit and/or activate several proteins involved in membrane fusion and vesicular transport [5, 6]. They associate with specific compartments after activation, which makes Rab GTPases ideal candidates for controlling motor protein binding to specific membranes. We and others [7] have identified a protein, called RILP (for Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein), that interacts with active Rab7 on late endosomes and lysosomes. Here we show that RILP prevents further cycling of Rab7. RILP expression induces the recruitment of functional dynein-dynactin motor complexes to Rab7-containing late endosomes and lysosomes. Consequently, these compartments are transported by these motors toward the minus end of microtubules, effectively inhibiting their transport toward the cell periphery. This signaling cascade may be responsible for timed and selective dynein motor recruitment onto late endosomes and lysosomes.},

Glycans present in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls have been shown to act as ligands for different receptors leading to different stimulating pathways, some of which need receptor co-involvement. However, among these ligand-receptor couples, none has been shown to discriminate the pathogenic yeast C. albicans. We explored the role of galectin-3, which binds C. albicans beta-1,2 mannosides. These glycans are specifically and prominently expressed at the surface of C. albicans but not on S. cerevisiae. Using a mouse cell line and galectin-3-deleted cells from knockout mice, we demonstrated a specific enhancement of the cellular response to C. albicans compared with S. cerevisiae, which depended on galectin-3 expression. However, galectin-3 was not required for recognition and endocytosis of yeasts. In contrast, using PMA-induced differentiated THP-1, we observed that the presence of TLR2 was required for efficient uptake and endocytosis of both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. TLR2 and galectin-3, which are expressed at the level of phagosomes containing C. albicans, were shown to be associated in differentiated macrophages after incubation with this sole species. These data suggest that macrophages differently sense C. albicans and S. cerevisiae through a mechanism involving TLR2 and galectin-3, which probably associate for binding of ligands expressing beta-1,2 mannosides specific to the C. albicans cell wall surface.},

Therefore, questions such as "How does mycobacterial cord formation occur?" and "Which molecular factors play a role in cord formation?" remain unanswered. At present, one of the problems in cording studies is the correct interpretation of cording morphology. Using optical microscopy, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between cording and clumping, which is a general property of mycobacteria due to their hydrophobic surfaces. In this work, we provide a new way to visualize cords in great detail using scanning electron microscopy, and we show the first scanning electron microscopy images of the ultrastructure of mycobacterial cords, making this technique the ideal tool for cording studies. This technique has enabled us to affirm that nonpathogenic mycobacteria also form microscopic cords. Finally, we demonstrate that a strong correlation exists between microscopic cords, rough colonial morphology, and increased persistence of mycobacteria inside macrophages.

  abstract = {The year 2020 was shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic which killed more people than any other infectious disease in this particular year. At the same time, the development of highly efficacious COVID-19 vaccines within less than a year raises hope that this threat can be tamed in the near future. For the last 200 years, the agent of tuberculosis (TB) has been the worst killer amongst all pathogens. Although a vaccine has been available for 100 years, TB remains a substantial threat. The TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), has saved tens of millions of lives since its deployment. It was the best and only choice available amongst many attempts to develop efficacious vaccines and all competitors, be they subunit vaccines, viable vaccines or killed whole cell vaccines have failed. Yet, BCG is insufficient. The last decades have witnessed a reawakening of novel vaccine approaches based on deeper insights into immunity underlying TB and BCG immunization. In addition, technical advances in molecular genetics and the design of viral vectors and adjuvants have facilitated TB vaccine development. This treatise discusses firstly early TB vaccine developments leading to BCG as the sole preventive measure which stood the test of time, but failed to significantly contribute to TB control and secondly more recent attempts to develop novel vaccines are described that focus on the genetically modified BCG-based vaccine VPM1002, which has become the frontrunner amongst viable TB vaccine candidates. It is hoped that highly efficacious vaccines against TB will become available even though it remains unclear whether and when this ambition can be accomplished. None the less it is clear that the goal of reducing TB morbidity and mortality by 90\% or 95\%, respectively, by 2030 as proposed by the World Health Organization depends significantly on better vaccines.},

Ethical behavior is defined as individuals or enterprises adhering to a non-corrupt work or business practice. A review of the academic literature is conducted drawing on perspectives from the political, economic, and anthropological sciences. Insights from a Danish research program are reported on. This program identifies five different actions for dealing with corruption: (1) no action; (2) withdrawals from markets; (3) decentralized decision-making process; (4) establishment of an anti-corruption code; and (5) mutual commitment through integrity pact. The following aspects of ethical behavior should be regulated through an anticorruption code: the company vis-a-vis political parties; gifts and entertainment expenses; political campaign contributions; and policy against small-scale corruption. Directions for future research are considered including the role of international organizations and multinational companies in fighting corruption and fostering ethical behavior; the role of countries and their governments; and the management systems.

  abstract = {The HMG (high-mobility group)-box-containing chromatin-remodelling factor SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) plays a key role in sex determination. Its role in the nucleus is critically dependent on two NLSs (nuclear localization signals) that flank its HMG domain: the C-terminally located ‘β-NLS’ that mediates nuclear transport through Impβ1 (importin β1) and the N-terminally located ‘CaM-NLS’ which is known to recognize the calcium-binding protein CaM (calmodulin). In the present study, we examined a number of missense mutations in the SRY CaM-NLS from human XY sex-reversed females for the first time, showing that they result in significantly reduced nuclear localization of GFP (green fluorescent protein)–SRY fusion proteins in transfected cells compared with wild-type. The CaM antagonist CDZ (calmidazolium chloride) was found to significantly reduce wild-type SRY nuclear accumulation, indicating dependence of SRY nuclear import on CaM. Intriguingly, the CaM-NLS mutants were all resistant to CDZ's effects, implying a loss of interaction with CaM, which was confirmed by direct binding experiments. CaM-binding/resultant nuclear accumulation was the only property of SRY found to be impaired by two of the CaM-NLS mutations, implying that inhibition of CaM-dependent nuclear import is the basis of sex reversal in these cases. Importantly, the CaM-NLS is conserved in other HMG-box-domain-containing proteins such as SOX-2, -9, -10 and HMGN1, all of which were found for the first time to rely on CaM for optimal nuclear localization. CaM-dependent nuclear translocation is thus a common mechanism for this family of important transcription factors.},

Such effects were not observed in NKT-KO mice. In CD4KO mice, minor synthesis of IFN-γ was detected on day 3 in sera but was completely abolished by day 7. The α-GalCer-induced IFN-γ production on day 3 was partially reduced in mice depleted of NK cells by treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody (Ab). Spleen cells obtained from infected and α- GalCer-treated mice on day 7 produced a large amount of IFN-γ upon restimulation with live organisms, while only a marginal level of production was detected in splenocytes from infected and vehicle-treated mice. Such effects were abolished in CD4KO and NKT-KO mice. Finally, the fungal loads in the lungs and spleen on days 7 and 14 were significantly reduced in α. GalCer-treated mice compared to those in control mice. In NKT. KO mice, local resistance elicited by α-GalCer was completely abolished, although no obvious exacerbation of infection was detected. Furthermore, treatment with anti-IFN-γ monoclonal Ab mostly abrogated the protective effect of this agent. Thus, our results indicated that activation of Vα14+ NKT cells resulted in an increased Th1 response and local resistance to C. neoformans through production of IFN-γ.},

However, the complete molecular pathology underlying MPTP-induced parkinsonism remains poorly understood. We used dual polarity matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to thoroughly image numerous glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in coronal brain tissue sections of MPTP-lesioned and control non-human primate brains (               Macaca mulatta               ). The results revealed specific distributions of several sulfatide lipid molecules based on chain-length, number of double bonds, and importantly, hydroxylation stage. More specifically, certain long-chain hydroxylated sulfatides with polyunsaturated chains in the molecular structure were depleted within motor-related brain regions in the MPTP-lesioned animals, e.g., external and internal segments of globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. In contrast, certain long-chain non-hydroxylated sulfatides were found to be elevated within the same brain regions. These findings demonstrate region-specific dysregulation of sulfatide metabolism within the MPTP-lesioned macaque brain. The depletion of long-chain hydroxylated sulfatides in the MPTP-induced pathology indicates oxidative stress and oligodendrocyte/myelin damage within the pathologically relevant brain regions. Hence, the presented findings improve our current understanding of the molecular pathology of MPTP-induced parkinsonism within primate brains, and provide a basis for further research regarding the role of dysregulated sulfatide metabolism in PD.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Classical twin studies and recent linkage analyses of African populations have revealed a potential involvement of host genetic factors in susceptibility or resistance to               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               infection. In order to identify the candidate genes involved and test their causal implication, we capitalized on the mouse model of tuberculosis, since inbred mouse strains also differ substantially in their susceptibility to infection. Two susceptible and two resistant mouse strains were aerogenically infected with 1,000 CFU of               M. tuberculosis               , and the regulation of gene expression was examined by Affymetrix GeneChip U74A array with total lung RNA 2 and 4 weeks postinfection. Four weeks after infection, 96 genes, many of which are involved in inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, were regulated in common. One hundred seven genes were differentially regulated in susceptible mouse strains, whereas 43 genes were differentially expressed only in resistant mice. Data mining revealed a bias towards the expression of genes involved in granulocyte pathophysiology in susceptible mice, such as an upregulation of those for the neutrophil chemoattractant LIX (CXCL5), interleukin 17 receptor, phosphoinositide kinase 3 delta, or gamma interferon-inducible protein 10. Following               M. tuberculosis               challenge in both airways or peritoneum, granulocytes were recruited significantly faster and at higher numbers in susceptible than in resistant mice. When granulocytes were efficiently depleted by either of two regimens at the onset of infection, only susceptible mice survived aerosol challenge with               M. tuberculosis               significantly longer than control mice. We conclude that initially enhanced recruitment of granulocytes contributes to susceptibility to tuberculosis.},

C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are a group of PRRs expressed by DCs and other myeloid cells that can recognize endogenous ligands as well as a wide range of exogenous structures present on pathogens. Dual roles in homeostasis and immunity have been demonstrated for some members of this receptor family. Largely due to their endocytic ability and subset specific expression, DC-expressed CLRs have been the focus of significant antigen-targeting studies. A number of CLRs function on the basis of signaling via association with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adapter proteins. Others contain ITAM-related motifs or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails. Here we review CLRs that induce intracellular signaling via a single tyrosine-based ITAM-like motif and highlight their relevance in terms of DC function.},

  abstract = {Autophagy (self-eating) is a conserved cellular degradation process that plays important roles in maintaining homeostasis and preventing nutritional, metabolic, and infection-mediated stresses. Autophagy dysfunction can have various pathological consequences, including tumor progression, pathogen hyper-virulence, and neurodegeneration. This review describes the mechanisms of autophagy and its associations with other cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and autosis. Autophagy has both positive and negative roles in infection, cancer, neural development, metabolism, cardiovascular health, immunity, and iron homeostasis. Genetic defects in autophagy can have pathological consequences, such as static childhood encephalopathy with neurodegeneration in adulthood, Crohn’s disease, hereditary spastic paraparesis, Danon disease, X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy, and sporadic inclusion body myositis. Further studies on the process of autophagy in different microbial infections could help to design and develop novel therapeutic strategies against important pathogenic microbes. This review on the progress and prospects of autophagy research describes various activators and suppressors, which could be used to design novel intervention strategies against numerous diseases and develop therapeutic drugs to protect human and animal health.},

Whether local recognition of antigen in nonlymphoid tissues during infection can impact the formation of Trm populations remains unresolved. Using skin infections with vaccinia virus (VacV)–expressing model antigens, we found that local antigen recognition had a profound impact on Trm formation. Activated CD8 \textsuperscript{+} T cells trafficked to VacV-infected skin in an inflammation-dependent, but antigen-independent, manner. However, after viral clearance, there was a subsequent ∼50-fold increase in Trm formation when antigen was present in the tissue microenvironment. Secondary antigen stimulation in nonlymphoid tissue caused CD8 \textsuperscript{+} T cells to rapidly express CD69 and be retained at the site of infection. Finally, Trm CD8 \textsuperscript{+} T cells that formed during VacV infection in an antigen-dependent manner became potent stimulators of localized antigen-specific inflammatory responses in the skin. Thus, our studies indicate that the presence of antigen in the nonlymphoid tissue microenvironment plays a critical role in the formation of functional Trm CD8 \textsuperscript{+} T cell populations, a finding with relevance for both vaccine design and prevention of inflammatory disorders. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The progression of human tuberculosis (TB) to active disease and transmission involves the development of a caseous granuloma that cavitates and releases infectious Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. In the current study, we exploited genome-wide microarray analysis to determine that genes for lipid sequestration and metabolism were highly expressed in caseous TB granulomas. Immunohistological analysis of these granulomas confirmed the disproportionate abundance of the proteins involved in lipid metabolism in cells surrounding the caseum; namely, adipophilin, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 and saposin C. Biochemical analysis of the lipid species within the caseum identified cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols and lactosylceramide, which implicated low-density lipoprotein-derived lipids as the most likely source. M. tuberculosis infection in vitro induced lipid droplet formation in murine and human macrophages. Furthermore, the M. tuberculosis cell wall lipid, trehalose dimycolate, induced a strong granulomatous response in mice, which was accompanied by foam cell formation. These results provide molecular and biochemical evidence that the development of the human TB granuloma to caseation correlates with pathogen-mediated dysregulation of host lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {GPRC5B recruitment of Src family kinases has been implicated in diet-induced insulin resistance. However, the mechanism of this action is not fully understood. Here, we report that GPRC5B-mediated phosphorylation of sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2)by Fyn is a crucial step in the development of insulin resistance. Lipid-induced metabolic stress augments SMS2 phosphorylation by facilitating the interaction of GPRC5B and SMS2. SMS2 phosphorylation reduces its ubiquitination, and consequently increases SMS2 protein abundance. Although ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG)have been known to be central mediators of lipid-induced insulin resistance, the accumulation of these lipids fails to impair insulin signaling in SMS2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Conversely, exogenous expression of a phosphomimetic SMS2 impairs insulin action in SMS2 knockout MEFs under metabolic stress conditions. We demonstrate that SMS2-generated DAG in sphingomyelin synthesis inhibits insulin signaling through JNK activation. Thus, GPRC5B links sphingolipid metabolism to diet-induced insulin resistance via SMS2-dependent DAG production.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Variants in multiple lysosomal enzymes increase Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk, including the genes encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and galactosylceramidase. Each of these enzymes generates ceramide by hydrolysis of sphingolipids in lysosomes, but the role of this common pathway in PD pathogenesis has not yet been explored. Variations in GBA1, the gene encoding GCase, are the most common genetic risk factor for PD. The lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B has recently been implicated as an important genetic modifier of disease penetrance in individuals harboring GBA1 variants, suggesting a mechanistic link between these enzymes. Here, we found that ceramide activates cathepsin B, and identified a novel role for cathepsin B in mediating prosaposin cleavage to form saposin C, the lysosomal coactivator of GCase. Interestingly, this pathway was disrupted in Parkin-linked PD models, and upon treatment with inhibitor of ASMase which resulted in decreased ceramide production. Conversely, increasing ceramide production by inhibiting acid ceramidase activity was sufficient to upregulate cathepsin B- and saposin C-mediated activation of GCase. These results highlight a mechanistic link between ceramide and cathepsin B in regulating GCase activity and suggest that targeting lysosomal ceramide or cathepsin B represents an important therapeutic strategy for activating GCase in PD and related disorders.},

Although there are many studies on lipid rafts, the direct observation of lipid rafts is still challenging owing to two critical reasons. One is the lack of an appropriate fluorescent probe mimicking the native behavior of raft lipids; fluorescent labeling often alters the intrinsic disposition of raft lipids. The other is their spatio-temporal stability; the size of lipid rafts is much smaller than the optical resolution of usual microscopy and their lifetime is much shorter than image acquisition duration. These issues are hampering the visualization of lipid rafts. Our review highlights the recent advances in microscopic techniques to visualize the partition and dynamic behavior of SMs, disclosing the detailed structure of lipid rafts. Moreover, we will elucidate the importance of SM-SM interactions in the stabilization of signaling platforms as lipid rafts.},

How SM contributes to the formation and function of these domains remains unknown, primarily because of the scarcity of suitable fluorescent SM analogs. We developed new fluorescent SM analogs by conjugating a hydrophilic fluorophore to the SM choline headgroup without eliminating its positive charge, via a hydrophilic nonaethylene glycol linker. The new analogs behaved similarly to the native SM in terms of their partitioning behaviors in artificial liquid order-disorder phase-separated membranes and detergent-resistant PM preparations. Single fluorescent molecule tracking in the live-cell PM revealed that they indirectly interact with each other in cholesterol- and sphingosine backbone–dependent manners, and that, for ∼10–50 ms, they undergo transient colocalization-codiffusion with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, CD59 (in monomers, transient-dimer rafts, and clusters), in CD59-oligomer size–, cholesterol-, and GPI anchoring–dependent manners. These results suggest that SM continually and rapidly exchanges between CD59-associated raft domains and the bulk PM.},

All four saposins are structurally similar to one another including placement of six cysteines, a glycosylation site, and conserved prolines in identical positions. In spite of the structural similarities, the specificity and mode of activation of sphingolipid hydrolases differs among individual saposins. Saposins appear to be lysosomal proteins, exerting their action upon lysosomal hydrolases. Prosaposin is a 70 kDa glycoprotein containing four domains, one for each saposin, placed in tandem. Prosaposin is proteolytically processed to saposins A, B, C and D, apparently within lysosomes. However, prosaposin also exists as an integral membrane protein not destined for lysosomal entry and exists uncleaved in many biological fluids such as seminal plasma, human milk, and cerebrospinal fluid, where it appears to have a different function. The physiological significance of saposins is underlined by their accumulation in tissues of lysosomal storage disease patients and the occurrence of sphingolipidosis due to mutations in the prosaposin gene.

Innate immunity plays an important role in the host defense against               M. tuberculosis               , and the first step in this process is recognition of MTB by cells of the innate immune system. Several classes of pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) are involved in the recognition of               M. tuberculosis               , including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and Nod-like receptors (NLRs). Among the TLR family, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 and their adaptor molecule MyD88 play the most prominent roles in the initiation of the immune response against tuberculosis. In addition to TLRs, other PRRs such as NOD2, Dectin-1, Mannose receptor, and DC-SIGN are also involved in the recognition of               M. tuberculosis               . Human epidemiological studies revealed that genetic variation in genes encoding for PRRs and downstream signaling products influence disease susceptibility, severity, and outcome. More insight into PRRs and the recognition of mycobacteria, combined with immunogenetic studies in TB patients, does not only lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis but also may contribute to the design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.},

Every one of these chapters referred to the paper by Yamamoto et al. In that paper, treatment with 100 nM bafilomycin A(1) for 1 h blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in the rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cell line, based on data from electron microscopy. However, data from one of our labs noted an apparently different result in a relatively recent manuscript. Therefore, we decided to look into this more carefully.},

  abstract = {Lipid droplet (LD) formation occurs during infection of macrophages with numerous intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is believed that M. tuberculosis and other bacteria specifically provoke LD formation as a pathogenic strategy in order to create a depot of host lipids for use as a carbon source to fuel intracellular growth. Here we show that LD formation is not a bacterially driven process during M. tuberculosis infection, but rather occurs as a result of immune activation of macrophages as part of a host defense mechanism. We show that an IFN-γ driven, HIF-1α dependent signaling pathway, previously implicated in host defense, redistributes macrophage lipids into LDs. Furthermore, we show that M. tuberculosis is able to acquire host lipids in the absence of LDs, but not in the presence of IFN-γ induced LDs. This result uncouples macrophage LD formation from bacterial acquisition of host lipids. In addition, we show that IFN-γ driven LD formation supports the production of host protective eicosanoids including PGE2 and LXB4. Finally, we demonstrate that HIF-1α and its target gene Hig2 are required for the majority of LD formation in the lungs of mice infected with M. tuberculosis, thus demonstrating that immune activation provides the primary stimulus for LD formation in vivo. Taken together our data demonstrate that macrophage LD formation is a host-driven component of the adaptive immune response to M. tuberculosis, and suggest that macrophage LDs are not an important source of nutrients for M. tuberculosis.},

We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status. Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death), but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels. Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed. In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota, dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk.},

We found that a long-chain, ordered-domain preferring PyrSM was targeted Hrs and Tsg101 dependently to late endosomal compartments and recycled to the plasma membrane in an NPC1- and cholesterol-dependent manner. A short-chain, disordered domain preferring PyrSM recycled more effectively, by using Hrs-, Tsg101- and NPC1-independent routing that was insensitive to cholesterol loading. Similar chain length-dependent recycling was observed for unlabeled sphingomyelins (SMs). The findings 1) establish acyl chain length as an important determinant in the endocytic trafficking of SMs, 2) implicate ESCRT complex proteins and NPC1 in the endocytic recycling of ordered domain lipids to the plasma membrane, and 3) introduce long-chain PyrSM as the first fluorescent lipid tracing this pathway.},

The lung bacterial load, systemic immune response, histology, and immune cell composition were investigated over time. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis, cellular and tissue-level assays, and immunofluorescent imaging were performed on lung tissue to define and compare immune activation and pathogenesis between Mtb-AG and Mtb-SC infection. Lung bacillary loads, disease scores, lesion size, and structure were significantly higher in Mtb-AG than Mtb-SC infected animals. Differences in immune cell distribution and activation were noted in the lungs of the two groups of infected animals. Consistently larger lung granulomas with large aggregates of Mtb, extensive necrotic foci, and elevated matrix metalloproteases expression were observed in Mtb-AG infected rabbits. Our findings suggest that bacillary aggregation increases Mtb fitness for improved growth and accelerates lung inflammation and infected~host~cell death, thereby exacerbating disease pathology in the lungs. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using conventional and immunoelectron microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that Golgi stacks were converted into clusters of vesicles and tubules, and that the tERs (marked by Sec23p) lost their focused organization and were now dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. However, we found that this morphologically altered exocytic pathway was nevertheless largely competent in anterograde protein transport using two different assays. The effects were specific for dp115. Depletion of the Drosophila homologues of GM130 and syntaxin 5 (dSed5p) did not lead to an effect on the tER organization, though the Golgi stacks were greatly vesiculated in the cells depleted of dSed5p. Taken together, these studies suggest that dp115 could be implicated in the architecture of both the Golgi stacks and the tER sites.},

Acid ceramidase (AC) further degrades ceramide to sphingosine which can then be phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate. Ceramide and its metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate have been shown to antagonistically regulate apoptosis, cellular differentiation, proliferation and cell migration. Inhibitors of ASM or AC therefore hold promise for a number of new clinical therapies, e.g. for Alzheimer's disease and major depression on the one hand and cancer on the other. Inhibitors of ASM have been known for a long time. Cationic amphiphilic substances induce the detachment of ASM protein from inner lysosomal membranes with its consecutive inactivation, thereby working as functional inhibitors of ASM. We recently experimentally identified a large number of hitherto unknown functional inhibitors of ASM and determined specific physicochemical properties of such cationic amphiphilic substances that functionally inhibit ASM. We propose the acronym "FIASMA" (Functional Inhibitor of Acid SphingoMyelinAse) for members of this large group of compounds with a broad range of new clinical indications. FIASMAs differ markedly with respect to molecular structure and current clinical indication. Most of the available FIASMAs are licensed for medical use in humans, are minimally toxic and may therefore be applied for disease states associated with increased activity of ASM.},

These entities named FIASMAs (Functional Inhibitors of Acid SphingoMyelinAse), therefore, can be potentially used to treat diseases associated with enhanced activity of ASM, such as Alzheimer's disease, major depression, radiation- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and endotoxic shock syndrome. Residual activity of ASM measured in the presence of 10 µM drug concentration shows a bimodal distribution; thus the tested drugs can be classified into two groups with lower and higher inhibitory activity. All FIASMAs share distinct physicochemical properties in showing lipophilic and weakly basic properties. Hierarchical clustering of Tanimoto coefficients revealed that FIASMAs occur among drugs of various chemical scaffolds. Moreover, FIASMAs more frequently violate Lipinski's Rule-of-Five than compounds without effect on ASM. Inhibition of ASM appears to be associated with good permeability across the blood-brain barrier. In the present investigation, we developed a novel structure-property-activity relationship by using a random forest-based binary classification learner. Virtual screening revealed that only six out of 768 (0.78\%) compounds of natural products functionally inhibit ASM, whereas this inhibitory activity occurs in 135 out of 2028 (6.66\%) drugs licensed for medical use in humans.},

  abstract = {Bloodstream form African trypanosomes are thought to rely exclusively upon glycolysis, using glucose as a substrate, for ATP production. Indeed, the pathway has long been considered a potential therapeutic target to tackle the devastating and neglected tropical diseases caused by these parasites. However, plasma membrane glucose and glycerol transporters are both expressed by trypanosomes and these parasites can infiltrate tissues that contain glycerol. Here, we show that bloodstream form trypanosomes can use glycerol for gluconeogenesis and for ATP production, particularly when deprived of glucose following hexose transporter depletion. We demonstrate that Trypanosoma brucei hexose transporters 1 and 2 (THT1 and THT2) are localized to the plasma membrane and that knockdown of THT1 expression leads to a growth defect that is more severe when THT2 is also knocked down. These data are consistent with THT1 and THT2 being the primary routes of glucose supply for the production of ATP by glycolysis. However, supplementation of the growth medium with glycerol substantially rescued the growth defect caused by THT1 and THT2 knockdown. Metabolomic analyses with heavy-isotope labelled glycerol demonstrated that trypanosomes take up glycerol and use it to synthesize intermediates of gluconeogenesis, including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphates, which feed the pentose phosphate pathway and variant surface glycoprotein biosynthesis. We used Cas9-mediated gene knockout to demonstrate a gluconeogenesis-specific, but fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Tb927.9.8720)-independent activity, converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate. In addition, we observed increased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the succinate shunt. Thus, contrary to prior thinking, gluconeogenesis can operate in bloodstream form T. brucei. This pathway, using glycerol as a physiological substrate, may be required in mammalian host tissues.},

  abstract = {Cross-presentation of antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for initiation of anti-tumor immune responses. Yet, key steps involved in trafficking of antigens taken up by DCs remain incompletely understood. Here, we screen 700 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identify 37 enhancers of antigen import from endolysosomes into the cytosol. To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model. Thus, inefficient antigen import into the cytosol limits antigen cross-presentation, restraining the potency of anti-tumor immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockers.},

  abstract = {The bovine form of the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) shows striking similarity to the human form of the disease. It has, however, been mapped to a genomic region not harboring the bovine orthologue of the SMN gene, mutation of which causes human SMA. After refinement of the mapping results we analyzed positional and functional candidate genes. One of three candidate genes, FVT1, encoding 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, which catalyzes a crucial step in the glycosphingolipid metabolism, showed a G-to-A missense mutation that changes Ala-175 to Thr. The identified mutation is limited to SMA-affected animals and carriers and always appears in context of the founder haplotype. The Ala variant found in healthy animals showed the expected 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase activity in an in vitro enzyme assay. Importantly, the Thr variant found in SMA animals showed no detectable activity. Surprisingly, in an in vivo assay the mutated gene complements the growth defect of a homologous yeast knockout strain as well as the healthy variant. This finding explains the viability of affected newborn calves and the later neuron-specific onset of the disease, which might be due to the high sensitivity of these neurons to changes in housekeeping functions. Taken together, the described mutation in FVT1 is a strong candidate for causality of SMA in cattle. This result provides an animal model for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the development of SMA and will allow efficient selection against the disease in cattle. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Using quantitative proteomics, we found that lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination and degradation of two lymphoid transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, by the CRBN-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are essential transcription factors in multiple myeloma. A single amino acid substitution of IKZF3 conferred resistance to lenalidomide-induced degradation and rescued lenalidomide-induced inhibition of cell growth. Similarly, we found that lenalidomide-induced interleukin-2 production in T cells is due to depletion of IKZF1 and IKZF3. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of action for a therapeutic agent: alteration of the activity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to selective degradation of specific targets.},

We describe an integrative chemical genomic and proteomic approach combining the use of differentially active analogs of small molecule probes with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-mediated affinity enrichment, followed by subsequent testing of candidate targets using RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. We applied this approach to characterizing the natural product K252a and its ability to potentiate neuregulin-1 (Nrg1)/ErbB4 (v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4)-dependent neurotrophic factor signaling and neuritogenesis. We show that AAK1 (adaptor-associated kinase 1) is a relevant target of K252a, and that the loss of AAK1 alters ErbB4 trafficking and expression levels, providing evidence for a previously unrecognized role for AAK1 in Nrg1-mediated neurotrophic factor signaling. Similar strategies should lead to the discovery of novel targets for therapeutic development. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Much of the work in this arena is logically focused on the interaction at mucosal surfaces as this is a primary site of interaction. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that the effects of the microbiota have a much farther reach including the systemic immune system. While there are some similarities to effects at mucosal surfaces (i.e. reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells, diminished innate responses), there are some important differences that we highlight such as the response to immunogens and bacterial antigens. We propose that understanding the details of how specific components of the microbiota influence the systemic immune system likely will have significant impact on our understanding the pathophysiology of a variety of autoimmune diseases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Ceramides are abundant in tissues and have well-established biological functions. On the contrary, dihydroceramides are less prevalent, and despite their hitherto characterization as inert lipids, studies of the past decade began to unravel their implication in various biological processes distinct from those involving ceramides. These processes include cellular stress responses and autophagy, cell growth, pro-death or pro-survival pathways, hypoxia, and immune responses. In addition, their plasma concentration has been related to metabolic diseases and shown as a long-term predictor of type 2 diabetes onset. They are thus important players and potential biomarkers in pathologies ranging from diabetes to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

In MVBs, acid ceramidase (aCDase) converts ceramide into sphingosine and increases the formation of sphingosine-rich intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Once HSV-1 particles reach MVBs, sphingosine-rich ILVs bind to HSV-1 particles, which restricts fusion with the limiting endosomal membrane and prevents cellular infection. Lack of aCDase in macrophage cultures or in Asah1−/− mice results in replication of HSV-1 and Asah1−/− mice die soon after systemic or intravaginal inoculation. The treatment of macrophages with sphingosine enhancing compounds blocks HSV-1 propagation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of this pathway. In conclusion, aCDase loads ILVs with sphingosine, which prevents HSV-1 capsids from penetrating into the cytosol.},

  abstract = {The literature suggests that cholesterol and sphin-gomyelin might be essentially confined to plasma membranes in mammalian cells; however, this premise has thus far escaped a direct test. We explored the issue in three ways. First, we fractionated whole homogenates of cultured human fibroblasts by equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation. We found that the profiles of cholesterol and sphingomyelin were indistinguishable from those of two plasma membrane markers , 5' nucleotidase and [3H]galactose, which was conjugated to the surface of intact cells from an exogenous donor by galactosyltransferase. Second, we determined the relative surface areas of intact cells from their uptake of 1-(4-trimethyl-amino)phenyl-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene, a cationic fluorescent dye which partitions into but does not cross plasma membranes. Relative to human red cell ghosts, the apparent surface area of the fibroblasts was 17,500 pm2/cell while for canine hepatocytes, the value was 11,500 pm2/cell. The relative ratios of cell cholesterol to dye binding (hence, surface area) were quite similar in ghosts, fibroblasts, and liver cells; namely 1.0,1.12, and 0.67, respectively. Finally, we found that the specific ratios of both cholesterol and sphingomyelin to 5' nucleotidase were only 10\% less in gradient-purified plasma membranes than in whole homogenates. Similar results were obtained using an entirely different method of purification: two-phase aqueous partition. The cholesterol and sphingomyelin in fractions rich in other membranes was closely proportional to their 5' nucleotidase content , suggesting that the presence of these lipids reflected contamination by plasma membrane fragments. The 5' nucleotidase/phospholipid ratio in the purified plasma membrane fraction was roughly twice that in whole cells. We conclude that the compartment marked by 5' nucleotidase in cultured human fibroblasts contains approximately 90\% of the two named lipids and half the cell phospholipid phosphorus.},

  abstract = {The long-term history of the Earth–Moon system as reconstructed from the geological record remains unclear when based on fossil growth bands and tidal laminations. A possibly more robust method is provided by the sedimentary record of Milankovitch cycles (climatic precession, obliquity, and orbital eccentricity), whose relative ratios in periodicity change over time as a function of a decreasing Earth spin rate and increasing lunar distance. However, for the critical older portion of Earth’s history where information on Earth–Moon dynamics is sparse, suitable sedimentary successions in which these cycles are recorded remain largely unknown, leaving this method unexplored. Here we present results of cyclostratigraphic analysis and high-precision U–Pb zircon dating of the lower Paleoproterozoic Joffre Member of the Brockman Iron Formation, NW Australia, providing evidence for Milankovitch forcing of regular lithological alternations related to Earth’s climatic precession and orbital eccentricity cycles. Combining visual and statistical tools to determine their hierarchical relation, we estimate an astronomical precession frequency of 108.6 ± 8.5 arcsec/y, corresponding to an Earth–Moon distance of 321,800 ± 6,500 km and a daylength of 16.9 ± 0.2 h at 2.46 Ga. With this robust cyclostratigraphic approach, we extend the oldest reliable datum for the lunar recession history by more than 1 billion years and provide a critical reference point for future modeling and geological investigation of Precambrian Earth–Moon system evolution.},

Recent studies unraveled Mtb's capacity to acquire saturated and monounsaturated FAs via the Mce1 importer. However, upon activation, macrophages produce polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mammal-specific FAs mediating the generation of immunomodulatory eicosanoids. Here, we asked how Mtb modulates de novo synthesis of PUFAs in primary mouse macrophages and whether this benefits host or pathogen. Quantitative lipidomics revealed that Mtb infection selectively activates the biosynthesis of ω6 PUFAs upstream of the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid (AA) via transcriptional activation of Fads2. Inhibiting FADS2 in infected macrophages impaired their inflammatory and antimicrobial responses but had no effect on Mtb growth in host cells nor mice. Using a click-chemistry approach, we found that Mtb efficiently imports ω6 PUFAs via Mce1 in axenic culture, including AA. Further, Mtb preferentially internalized AA over all other FAs within infected macrophages by mechanisms partially depending on Mce1 and supporting intracellular persistence. Notably, IFNγ repressed de novo synthesis of AA by infected mouse macrophages and restricted AA import by intracellular Mtb. Together, these findings identify AA as a major FA substrate for intracellular Mtb, whose mobilization by innate immune responses is opportunistically hijacked by the pathogen and downregulated by IFNγ.},

  abstract = {Ceramide is an important lipid signaling molecule and a key intermediate in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Recent studies have implied a previously unappreciated role for the ceramide N-acyl chain length, in as much as ceramides containing specific fatty acids appear to play defined roles in cell physiology. The discovery of a family of mammalian ceramide synthases (CerS), each of which utilizes a restricted subset of acyl-CoAs for ceramide synthesis, strengthens this notion. We now report the characterization of mammalian CerS2. qPCR analysis reveals that CerS2 mRNA is found at the highest level of all CerS and has the broadest tissue distribution. CerS2 has a remarkable acyl-CoA specificity, showing no activity using C16:0-CoA and very low activity using C18:0, rather utilizing longer acyl-chain CoAs (C20-C26) for ceramide synthesis. There is a good correlation between CerS2 mRNA levels and levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin containing long acyl chains, at least in tissues where CerS2 mRNA is expressed at high levels. Interestingly, the activity of CerS2 can be regulated by another bioactive sphingolipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), via interaction of S1P with two residues that are part of an S1P receptor-like motif found only in CerS2. These findings provide insight into the biochemical basis for the ceramide N-acyl chain composition of cells, and also reveal a novel and potentially important interplay between two bioactive sphingolipids that could be relevant to the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and the opposing functions that these lipids play in signaling pathways. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

In amouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, sphingolipid profiling revealed increases in not only theCerS5-derived ceramides but alsoinvery longchain (VLC) ceramides derived fromCerS2.Overexpression of CerS2 elevated VLC ceramides caused insulin resistance, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitophagy. Palmitate induced CerS2 and oxidative stress, mitophagy, and apoptosis, which were prevented by depletion of CerS2. Neither overexpression nor knockdown of CerS5 had any function in these processes, suggesting a chain-length dependent impact of ceramides on mitochondrial function. This concept was also supported by the observation that synthetic mitochondria-targeted ceramides led to mitophagy in a manner proportional to N-acyl chain length. Finally, blocking mitophagy exacerbated cell death. Taken together, our results support a model by which CerS2 and VLC ceramides have a distinct role in lipotoxicity, leading to mitochondrial damage, which results in subsequent adaptive mitophagy.

  abstract = {Many pathogenic intracellular bacteria manipulate the host phago-endosomal system to establish and maintain a permissive niche. The fate and identity of these intracellular compartments is controlled by phosphoinositide lipids. By mechanisms that have remained undefined, a Francisella pathogenicity island-encoded secretion system allows phagosomal escape and replication of bacteria within host cell cytoplasm. Here we report the discovery that a substrate of this system, outside pathogenicity island A (OpiA), represents a family of wortmannin-resistant bacterial phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase enzymes with members found in a wide range of intracellular pathogens, including Rickettsia and Legionella spp. We show that OpiA acts on the Francisella-containing phagosome and promotes bacterial escape into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phenotypic consequences of OpiA inactivation are mitigated by endosomal maturation arrest. Our findings suggest that Francisella, and likely other intracellular bacteria, override the finely tuned dynamics of phagosomal PI(3)P in order to promote intracellular survival and pathogenesis. Bacterial effector proteins can modulate host cell trafficking to establish a replicative niche. Ledvina et al. report the discovery that the Francisella effector protein OpiA is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that acts on Francisella-containing phagosomes, promoting bacterial escape into the cytoplasm. OpiA-like PI3Ks are also found to be broadly distributed.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is an essential mechanism in innate immune defense, and in maintaining homeostasis to eliminate apoptotic cells or microbes, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Legionella pneumophila. After internalizing microbial pathogens via phagocytosis, phagosomes undergo a series of ‘maturation’ steps, to form an increasingly acidified compartment and subsequently fuse with the lysosome to develop into phagolysosomes and effectively eliminate the invading pathogens. Through this mechanism, phagocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells, are involved in the processing of microbial pathogens and antigen presentation to T cells to initiate adaptive immune responses. Therefore, phagocytosis plays a role in the bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. However, intracellular bacteria have evolved diverse strategies to survive and replicate within hosts. In this review, we describe the sequential stages in the phagocytosis process. We also discuss the immune evasion strategies used by pathogens to regulate phagosome maturation during intracellular bacterial infection, and indicate that these might be used for the development of potential therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases.},

Recent progress in multiomics-based analyses and methodological approaches has revealed that human health and diseases are closely related to the homeostasis of sphingolipid metabolism, and disease-specific alterations in sphingolipids and related enzymes can be prognostic markers of human disease progression. Accumulating human clinical data from genome-wide association studies and preclinical data from disease models provide support for the notion that sphingolipids are the missing pieces that supplement our understanding of immune responses and diseases in which the functions of the involved proteins and nucleotides have been established. In this review, we analyze sphingolipid-related enzymes and reported human diseases to understand the important roles of sphingolipid metabolism. We discuss the defects and alterations in sphingolipid metabolism in human disease, along with functional roles in immune cells. We also introduce several methodological approaches and provide summaries of research on sphingolipid modulators in this review that should be helpful in studying the roles of sphingolipids in preclinical studies for the investigation of experimental and molecular medicines.},

As conventional treatment is not effective against infections by persisters and MDR-Mtb, novel therapeutics are needed. Several approaches were proposed to kill persisters by altering their metabolism, obviating the need to target active processes. Here, we adapted a biofilm culture to model Mtb persister-like bacilli (PLB) and demonstrated that PLB underwent trehalose metabolism remodeling. PLB use trehalose as an internal carbon to biosynthesize central carbon metabolism intermediates instead of cell surface glycolipids, thus maintaining levels of ATP and antioxidants. Similar changes were identified in Mtb following antibiotic-treatment, and MDR-Mtb as mechanisms to circumvent antibiotic effects. This suggests that trehalose metabolism is associated not only with transient drug-tolerance but also permanent drug-resistance, and serves as a source of adjunctive therapeutic options, potentiating antibiotic efficacy by interfering with adaptive strategies.},

  abstract = {Lysosomal prosaposin (65 kDa) is a nonenzymic protein that is transported to the lysosomes in a mannose 6-phosphate-independent manner. Selective deletion of the functional domains of prosaposin indicates that the D domain and the carboxyl-terminal region are necessary for its transport to the lysosomes. Inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis, such as fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthate potassium salt (D609), also interfere with the trafficking of prosaposin to lysosomes. In this study, we examine sphingomyelin as a direct candidate for the trafficking of prosaposin. Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells overexpressing prosaposin or an albumin/prosaposin construct were incubated with these inhibitors, treated with sphingolipids, and then immunostained. Sphingomyelin restored the immunostaining in lysosomes in both FB 1- and D609-treated cells and ceramide reestablished the immunostaining in FB 1-treated cells only. D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-l-propanol (PDMP), which inhibits glycosphingolipids, had no effect on the immunostaining pattern. To determine whether sphingomyelin has the same effect on the transport of endogenous prosaposin, testicular explants were treated with FB 1 and D609. Sphingomyelin restored prosaposin immunogold labeling in the lysosomes of FB 1- and D609-treated Sertoli cells, whereas ceramide restored the label in FB 1 treatment only. Albumin linked to the D and COOH-terminal domains of prosaposin was used as a dominant negative competitor. The construct blocked the targeting of prosaposin and induced accumulation of membrane in the lysosomes, demonstrating that the construct uses the same transport pathway as endogenous prosaposin. In conclusion, our results showed that sphingomyclin, the D domain, and its adjacent COOH-terminal region play a crucial role in the transport of prosaposin to lysosomes. Although the precise nature of this lipid-protein interaction is not well established, it is proposed that sphingomyelin microdomains (lipid rafts) are part of a mechanism ensuring correct intercellular trafficking of prosaposin.},

How ZIKV dysregulates lipid networks to allow this, and consequences for disease, is poorly understood. Here, we perform comprehensive lipidomics to create a lipid network map during ZIKV infection. We find that ZIKV significantly alters host lipid composition, with the most striking changes seen within subclasses of sphingolipids. Ectopic expression of ZIKV NS4B protein results in similar changes, demonstrating a role for NS4B in modulating sphingolipid pathways. Disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis in various cell types, including human neural progenitor cells, blocks ZIKV infection. Additionally, the sphingolipid ceramide redistributes to ZIKV replication sites, and increasing ceramide levels by multiple pathways sensitizes cells to ZIKV infection. Thus, we identify a sphingolipid metabolic network with a critical role in ZIKV replication and show that ceramide flux is a key mediator of ZIKV infection.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of IL-33 pretreatment on anti-fungal response using an acute Candida albicans peritoneal infection model. IL-33 pretreatment induced a rapid fungal clearance and markedly reduced the C. albicans infection-associated mortality. The priming effect of IL-33 occurred during multiple steps of the neutrophil-mediated anti-fungal response. First, the anti-fungal effect occurred due to the rapid and massive recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection as a result of the release of CXCR2 chemokines by peritoneal macrophages and by reversal of the TLR-induced reduction of CXCR2 expression in neutrophils during IL-33 priming. Second, conditioning of neutrophils by IL-33 activated the TLR and dectin-1 signaling pathways, leading to the upregulation of complement receptor 3 expression induced by C. albicans. Upregulated CR3 in turn increased the phagocytosis of opsonized C. albicans and resulted in the production of high levels of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent enhanced killing activity of neutrophils. Taken together, our results suggest that IL-33 can regulate the anti-fungal activity of neutrophils by collaborative modulation of the signaling pathways of different classes of innate immune receptors.},

However, current invasive techniques for lipid studies prevent characterization of the dynamic interactions between various lipid metabolism pathways. Here, we describe a noninvasive approach to study lipid metabolisms using a multifunctional coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope. Using living Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, we report label-free visualization of coexisting neutral and autofluorescent lipid species. We find that the relative expression level of neutral and autofluorescent lipid species can be used to assay the genotypephenotype relationship of mutant C. elegans with deletions in the genes encoding lipid synthesis transcription factors, LDL receptors, transforming growth factor β receptors, lipid desaturation enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, by coupling CARS with fingerprint confocal Raman analysis, we analyze the unsaturation level of lipids in wild-type and mutant C. elegans. Our study shows that complex genotype-phenotype relationships between lipid storage, peroxidation, and desaturation can be rapidly and quantitatively analyzed in a single living C. elegans.-Le, T.

  abstract = {Phosphoinositides have a pivotal role in the maturation of nascent phagosomes into microbicidal phagolysosomes. Following degradation of their contents, mature phagolysosomes undergo resolution, a process that remains largely uninvestigated. Here we studied the role of phosphoinositides in phagolysosome resolution. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), which is abundant in maturing phagolysosomes, was depleted as they tubulated and resorbed. Depletion was caused, in part, by transfer of phagolysosomal PtdIns(4)P to the endoplasmic reticulum, a process mediated by oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L), a RAB7 effector. ORP1L formed discrete tethers between the phagolysosome and the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in distinct regions with alternating PtdIns(4)P depletion and enrichment. Tubules emerged from PtdIns(4)P-rich regions, where ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 8B (ARL8B) and SifA- and kinesin-interacting protein/pleckstrin homology domain-containing family M member 2 (SKIP/PLEKHM2) accumulated. SKIP binds preferentially to monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, of which PtdIns(4)P is most abundant in phagolysosomes, contributing to their tubulation. Accordingly, premature hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P impaired SKIP recruitment and phagosome resolution. Thus, resolution involves phosphoinositides and tethering of phagolysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Levin-Konigsberg et al. show that resorption of the phagolysosome after degradation of its contents requires transfer of PI4P and tethering to the ER, both mediated by oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L).},

Proteomic determinations and dynamic microscopy of live cells led to conflicting conclusions. Recent insights into the existence of a variety of membrane contact sites may help reconcile the seemingly disparate views. Specifically, earlier results can be rationalized considering that the ER forms specialized membrane contact sites with nascent and maturing phagosomes, without undergoing fusion. The composition and function of documented ER-to-phagosome contact sites is described. In addition, we speculate about the possible existence of additional phagosomal contact sites, based on available knowledge of interactions between the ER and other endocytic compartments. The interaction between phagosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been the subject of debate. Earlier observations that led to the suggestion that the ER fuses with the phagosomal membrane can now be explained in the light of recent evidence that intimate contacts form between the two organelles.

  abstract = {The tuberculosis (TB) vaccine bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated organism, but the mutation responsible for its attenuation has never been defined. Recent genetic studies identified a single DNA region of difference, RD1, which is absent in all BCG strains and present in all Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The 9 open-reading frames predicted within this 9.5-kb region are of unknown function, although they include the TB-specific immunodominant antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10. In this study, RD1 was deleted from MTB strain H37Rv, and virulence of H37Rv:ΔRD1 was assessed after infections of the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1, human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, and C57BL/6 mice. In each of these systems, the H37Rv:ΔRD1 strain was strikingly less virulent than MTB and was very similar to BCG controls. Therefore, it was concluded that genes within or controlled by RD1 are essential for MTB virulence and that loss of RD1 was important in BCG attenuation. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the world's tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, has been controversial since its first use in 1921 [1]. Since then, BCG has been administered to {$>$}3 billion people [2], with an excellent safety record [3]. Currently, an estimated 118 million doses are delivered each year [2]. However, in controlled clinical trials, the efficacy of BCG for preventing pulmonary TB has ranged widely, with some studies reporting no efficacy at all [4]. Despite high vaccination rates in much of the world, the ongoing death toll of TB remains ∼2 million deaths per year [5]. BCG is a live attenuated derivative of virulent Mycobacterium bovis, a close relative of M. tuberculosis (MTB). BCG was the result of more than a decade of continuous passage in vitro, but the genetic event responsible for its loss of virulence has never been defined. Understanding the molecular basis of BCG attenuation not only will provide insight into mechanisms of MTB pathogenesis but also will provide the impetus for much needed improvements in the TB vaccine. Recent work has identified several regions of the MTB chromosome that are missing from various BCG substrains [6-9]. Of these, only 1 region of difference, RD1, is missing from every BCG strain analyzed to date but is present in every MTB [10,11]. RD1 is the only known BCG mutation that may have occurred before clinical use of BCG in 1921 [8]. By annotation [12], the ∼9.5-kb RD1 deletion completely removes 7 genes (Rv3872-Rv3878) and truncates 2 others (Rv3871 and Rv3879c). None of the affected genes has any known function, although},

  abstract = {Conventional chemotherapy-based drug combinations have, until recently, been the backbone of most therapeutic strategies for cancer. In a time of emerging rationale drug development, targeted therapies are beginning to be added to traditional chemotherapeutics to synergistically enhance clinical responses. Of note, the importance of pro-apoptotic ceramide in mediating the anti-cancer effects of these therapies is becoming more apparent. Furthermore, reduced cellular ceramide in favour of pro-survival sphingolipids correlates with tumorigenesis and most importantly, drug resistance. Thus, agents that manipulate sphingolipid metabolism have been explored as potential anti-cancer agents and have recently demonstrated exciting potential to augment the efficacy of anti-cancer therapeutics. This review examines the biology underpinning these observations and the potential use of sphingolipid manipulating agents in the context of existing and emerging therapies for haematological malignancies.},

We investigated the role of +TIPs during phagocytosis in macrophages. Using RNA interference and dominant-negative approaches, we show that CLIP-170 is specifically required for efficient phagocytosis triggered by alphaMbeta2 integrin/complement receptor activation. This property is not observed for EB1 and EB3. Accordingly, whereas CLIP-170 is dynamically enriched at the site of phagocytosis, EB1 is not. Furthermore, we observe that CLIP-170 controls the recruitment of the formin mDia1, an actin-nucleating protein, at the onset of phagocytosis and thereby controls actin polymerization events that are essential for phagocytosis. CLIP-170 directly interacts with the formin homology 2 domain of mDia1. The interaction between CLIP-170 and mDia1 is negatively regulated during alphaMbeta2-mediated phagocytosis. Our results unravel a new microtubule/actin cooperation that involves CLIP-170 and mDia1 and that functions downstream of alphaMbeta2 integrins.},

Ceramide molecules spontaneously interact with each other and generate ceramide-enriched membrane domains. These ceramide-enriched domains further fuse, forming large ceramideenriched platforms that participate in the organization of receptors and in the amplification of signaling molecules. Recent studies have suggested several bacteria and bacterial toxins that stimulate the activation and the translocation of acid sphingomyelinase, which leads to the release of ceramide. The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system also regulates the internalization of bacteria into the host cell, the subsequent cytokine release, inflammatory response, and initiation of host cell apoptosis. In addition, ceramide has been implicated in the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes upon bacterial infection. Thus, this system modulates the reorganization of cell membrane receptors and intracellular signaling molecules during bacteria-host interactions. The acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide system may thus serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating infections.},

The US Army is developing tafenoquine (TQ), an analogue of primaquine (PQ), which is expected to be more effective in preventing malaria in deployed military personnel.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: To compare the prophylactic efficacy of TQ and PQ, a transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasite expressing the bioluminescent reporter protein luciferase was utilized to visualize and quantify parasite development in C57BL/6 albino mice treated with PQ and TQ in single or multiple regimens using a real-time in vivo imaging system (IVIS). As an additional endpoint, blood stage parasitaemia was monitored by flow cytometry. Comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) and liver distribution studies of oral and intravenous PQ and TQ were also performed.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Mice treated orally with three doses of TQ at 5 mg/kg three doses of PQ at 25 mg/kg demonstrated no bioluminescence liver signal and no blood stage parasitaemia was observed suggesting both drugs showed 100\% causal activity at the doses tested. Single dose oral treatment with 5 mg TQ or 25 mg of PQ, however, yielded different results as only TQ treatment resulted in causal prophylaxis in P. berghei sporozoite-infected mice. TQ is highly effective for causal prophylaxis in mice at a minimal curative single oral dose of 5 mg/kg, which is a five-fold improvement in potency versus PQ. PK studies of the two drugs administered orally to mice showed that the absolute bioavailability of oral TQ was 3.5-fold higher than PQ, and the AUC of oral TQ was 94-fold higher than oral PQ. The elimination half-life of oral TQ in mice was 28 times longer than PQ, and the liver tissue distribution of TQ revealed an AUC that was 188-fold higher than PQ.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The increased drug exposure levels and longer exposure time of oral TQ in the plasma and livers of mice highlight the lead quality attributes that explain the much improved efficacy of TQ when compared to PQ.},

GC B cells with improved affinity can either continue affinity-driven selection or exit the GC to differentiate into plasma cells (PCs) or memory B cells. Here we found that deleting E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl and Cbl-b (Cbls) in GC B cells resulted in the early exit of high-affinity antigen-specific B cells from the GC reaction and thus impaired clonal expansion. Cbls were highly expressed in GC light zone (LZ) B cells, where they promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of Irf4, a transcription factor facilitating PC fate choice. Strong CD40 and BCR stimulation triggered the Cbl degradation, resulting in increased Irf4 expression and exit from GC affinity selection. Thus, a regulatory cascade that is centered on the Cbl ubiquitin ligases ensures affinity-driven clonal expansion by connecting BCR affinity signals with differentiation programs. Li et al. find that clonal expansion of high affinity B cells in GCs depends on the Cbl ubiquitin ligases, which prevent premature GC exit by promoting the degradation of Irf4 in light zone B cells. Strong CD40 and BCR signals trigger Cbl degradation, thus enabling GC exit.},

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin and sits at the crossroads of sphingolipid biosynthesis. SMS has 2 isoforms: SMS1 and SMS2. Although they have the same SMS activity, they are different enzymes with distinguishable subcellular localizations and cell expression patterns. It is conceivable that these differences could yield different consequences, in terms of sphingolipid metabolism and its related atherogenesis. We created Sms1 gene knockout mice and found that Sms1 deficiency significantly decreased plasma, liver, and macrophage sphingomyelin (59\%, 45\%, and 54\%, respectively), but only had a marginal effect on ceramide levels. Surprisingly, we found that Sms1 deficiency dramatically increased glucosylceramide and GM3 levels in plasma, liver, and macrophages (4- to 12-fold), whereas Sms2 deficiency had no such effect. We evaluated the total SMS activity in tissues and found that Sms1 deficiency causes 77\% reduction in SMS activity in macrophages, indicating SMS1 is the major SMS in macrophages. Moreover, Sms1-deficient macrophages have a significantly higher glucosylceramide synthase activity. We also found that Sms1 deficiency significantly attenuated toll-like 4 receptor-mediated nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation after lipopolysaccharide treatment. To evaluate atherogenicity, we transplanted Sms1 knockout mouse bone marrow into low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (Sms1(-/-)→Ldlr(-/-)). After 3 months on a western diet, these animals showed a significant decrease of atherosclerotic lesions in the root and the entire aorta (35\% and 44\%, P{$<$}0.01, respectively) and macrophage content in lesions (51\%, P{$<$}0.05), compared with wild-type→Ldlr(-/-) mice. Sms1 deficiency decreases sphingomyelin, but dramatically increases the levels of glycosphingolipids. Atherosclerosis in Sms1(-/-)→Ldlr(-/-) mice is significantly decreased.},

However, in contrast to cholesterol functions, little is still known about the roles of sphingolipids and their metabolites. Perturbing the cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance was shown to induce narrow tubular plasma membrane invaginations enriched with sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that converts the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, and suggested a role for sphingosine phosphorylation in endocytic membrane trafficking. Here we show that sphingosine and sphingosine-like SphK1 inhibitors induced rapid and massive formation of vesicles in diverse cell types that accumulated as dilated late endosomes. However, much smaller vesicles were formed in SphK1-deficient cells. Moreover, inhibition or deletion of SphK1 prolonged the lifetime of sphingosine-induced vesicles. Perturbing the plasma membrane cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance abrogated vesicle formation. This massive endosomal influx was accompanied by dramatic recruitment of the intracellular SphK1 and Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain-containing proteins endophilin-A2 and endophilin-B1 to enlarged endosomes and formation of highly dynamic filamentous networks containing endophilin-B1 and SphK1. Together, our results highlight the importance of sphingosine and its conversion to sphingosine-1-phosphate by SphK1 in endocytic membrane trafficking.},

  abstract = {The cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein talin has been previously implicated in phagocytosis in Dictyostelium discoideum and mammalian phagocytes. However, its mechanism of action during internalization is not understood. Our data confirm that endogenous talin can occasionally be found at phagosomes forming around IgG- and C3bi-opsonized red blood cells in macrophages. Remarkably, talin knockdown specifically abrogates uptake through complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18, α M β 2 integrin) and not through the Fc γ receptor. We show that talin physically interacts with CR3/α M β 2 and that this interaction involves the talin head domain and residues W747 and F754 in the β 2 integrin cytoplasmic domain. The CR3/α M β 2 –talin head interaction controls not only talin recruitment to forming phagosomes but also CR3/α M β 2 binding activity, both in macrophages and transfected fibroblasts. However, the talin head domain alone cannot support phagocytosis. Our results establish for the first time at least two distinct roles for talin during CR3/α M β 2 -mediated phagocytosis, most noticeably activation of the CR3/α M β 2 receptor and phagocytic uptake.},

Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4 + T cells yet limited CD8 + T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.},

We demonstrate here that 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi, also referred to as SKI-II), FTY720 (Fingolimod), and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 activity with distinct kinetics, indicating that these compounds exhibit different binding modalities with sphingosine kinase 1. Thus, SKi is a mixed inhibitor of sphingosine and ATP binding, whereas FTY720 is competitive with sphingosine and uncompetitive with ATP, and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate is uncompetitive with sphingosine and is a mixed inhibitor with respect to ATP. A novel 'see-saw' model is proposed for the binding of inhibitor to catalytic and allosteric sites, the latter dependent on substrate binding, that provides an explanation for the different inhibitor kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression level and properties unique to an N-terminal 86 amino-acid isoform variant of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1b) in prostate cancer cells reduce its sensitivity to SKi-induced proteasomal degradation in comparison to SK1a, i.e. these two N-terminal variants of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1a and SK1b) have different properties. The reduced sensitivity of SK1b to proteasomal degradation in response to SKi is translated into specific changes in ceramide and S1P levels that leads to apoptosis of androgen-sensitive but not androgen-independent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Therefore, our proposed 'see-saw' model might be usefully employed in the design of sphingosine kinase inhibitors to promote apoptosis of chemotherapeutic resistant cancer cells. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is an actin-dependent process initiated from surface membrane ruffles that give rise to large endocytic vacuoles called macropinosomes. Macropinocytosis is important in a range of physiological processes; it is highly active in macrophages and dendritic cells where it is a major pathway for the capture of antigens, it is relevant to cell migration and tumour metastasis and it represents a portal of cell entry exploited by a range of pathogens. The molecular basis for the formation and maturation of macropinosomes has only recently begun to be defined. Here, we review the general characteristics of macropinocytosis, describe some of the regulators of this pathway, which have been identified to date and highlight strategies to explore the relevance of this endocytosis pathway in vivo.},

These enzymes are the products of a conserved gene and at the amino acid level share 82\% identity. In this study, we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses two ASMs, termed ASM-1 and ASM-2 encoded by two distinct genes, but lacks detectable neutral sphingomyelinase activity. The C. elegans ASMs are about 30\% identical with each other and with the human and murine enzymes. The conserved regions include a saposin-like domain, proline-rich domain, and a putative signal peptide. In addition, 16 cysteines distributed throughout the molecules, and selected glycosylation sites, are conserved. The expression of these genes in C. elegans is regulated during development. Asm-1 is preferentially expressed in the embryo, whereas asm-2 is predominantly expressed in postembryonic stages. When transfected as Flag-tagged proteins into COS-7 cells, ASM-1 is found almost entirely in a secreted form whereas only 20\% of ASM-2 is secreted. Only the secreted forms display enzymatic activity. Furthermore, ASM-2 requires addition of Zn2+ to be fully active, whereas ASM-1 is active in the absence of cation. C. elegans is the first organism to display two ASMs. This finding suggests the existence of an ASM gene family.},

  abstract = {Helminth is a general term meaning worm. The helminths are invertebrates characterized by elongated, flat or round bodies. In medically oriented schemes the flatworms or platyhelminths (platy from the Greek root meaning “flat”) include flukes and tapeworms. Roundworms are nematodes (nemato from the Greek root meaning “thread”). These groups are subdivided for convenience according to the host organ in which they reside, e.g., lung flukes, extraintestinal tapeworms, and intestinal roundworms. This chapter deals with the structure and development of the three major groups of helminths. Helminths develop through egg, larval (juvenile), and adult stages. Table 86-1 gives the names applied to various larval helminths. Knowledge of the different stages in relation to their growth and development is the basis for understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of helminth diseases, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of patients harboring these parasites. The contributions of various stages to disease are listed in Table 86-2. Platyhelminths and nematodes that infect humans have similar anatomic features that reflect common physiologic requirements and functions. The outer covering of helminths is the cuticle or tegument. Prominent external structures of flukes and cestodes are acetabula (suckers) or bothria (false suckers). Male nematodes of several species possess accessory sex organs that are external modifications of the cuticle. Internally, the alimentary, excretory, and reproductive systems can be identified by an experienced observer. Tapeworms are unique in lacking an alimentary canal. This lack means that nutrients must be absorbed through the tegument. The blood flukes and nematodes are bisexual. All other flukes and tapeworm species that infect humans are hermaphroditic. With few exceptions, adult flukes, cestodes, and nematodes produce eggs that are passed in excretions or secretions of the host. The various stages and their unique characteristics will be reviewed in more detail as each major group of helminths is considered.},

  abstract = {S100A4, a calcium-binding protein, can promote pulmonary fibrosis via fibroblast activation. Due partly to its various cellular origins, the exact role of S100A4 in the development of lung fibrosis remains elusive. Here, we show that in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, numbers of S100A4+ macrophages correlated well with S100A4 protein levels and occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in patients. A mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated S100A4+ macrophages as main source for extracellular S100A4 in the inflammatory phase. In vitro studies revealed that extracellular S100A4 could activate both mouse and human lung fibroblasts by upregulation of α-SMA and type I collagen, during which sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) increased. Inhibiting the S1P receptor subtypes S1P1/S1P3 abrogated fibroblast activation. Accordingly, absence or neutralization of S100A4 significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. Importantly, adoptive transfer of S100A4+ but not of S100A4- macrophages installed experimental lung injury in S100A4-/- mice that were otherwise not sensitive to fibrosis induction. Taken together, S100A4 released by macrophages promotes pulmonary fibrosis through activation of lung fibroblasts which is associated with S1P. This suggests that extracellular S100A4 or S100A4+ macrophages within the lung as promising targets for early clinical diagnosis or therapy of IPF.},

  abstract = {Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. It has been reported that oral administration of myriocin (an SPT inhibitor) decreases plasma sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol levels, and reduces atherosclerosis in apoE knockout (KO) mice. We studied cholesterol absorption in myriocin-treated WT or apoE KO animals and found that, after myriocin treatment, the mice absorbed significantly less cholesterol than controls, with no observable pathological changes in the small intestine. More importantly, we found that heterozygous Sptlc1 (a subunit of SPT) KO mice also absorbed significantly less cholesterol than controls. To understand the mechanism, we measured protein levels of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), ABCG5, and ABCA1, three key factors involved in intestinal cholesterol absorption. We found that NPC1L1 and ABCA1 were decreased, whereas ABCG5 was increased in the SPT deficient small intestine. SM levels on the apical membrane were also measured and they were significantly decreased in SPT deficient mice, compared with controls. In conclusion, SPT deficiency might reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by altering NPC1L1 and ABCG5 protein levels in the apical membranes of enterocytes through lowering apical membrane SM levels. This may be also true for ABCA1 which locates on basal membrane of enterocytes. Manipulation of SPT activity could thus provide a novel alternative treatment for dyslipidemia. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We previously found that liver Sptlc2 deficiency in early life impairs the development of adherens junctions. Here, we investigated the role of Sptlc2 deficiency in intestine. We treated Sptlc2-Flox/villin-Cre-ER T2 mice with tamoxifen (days 1, 2, and 3) to ablate Sptlc2 specifically in the intestine. At day 6 after tamoxifen treatment, Sptlc2-deficient mice had significantly decreased body weight with concurrent diarrhea and rectal bleeding. The number of goblet cells was reduced in both large and small intestine of Sptlc2-deficient mice compared with controls. Sptlc2 deficiency suppressed the level of mucin2 in the colon and increased circulating lipopolysaccharides, suggesting that SPT activity has a housekeeping function in the intestine. All Sptlc2-deficient mice died 7-10 days after tamoxifen treatment. Notably, supplementation with antibiotics and dexamethasone reduced lethality by 70\%. We also found that colon specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases had significantly reduced Sptlc2 expression, SPTLC2 staining, and goblet cell numbers.

However, numerous pathogens block macrophage-intrinsic immune responses, making it unclear how robust antimicrobial responses are generated. The intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila inhibits host translation, thereby impairing cytokine production by infected macrophages. Nevertheless, Legionella-infected macrophages induce an interleukin-1 (IL-1)-dependent inflammatory cytokine response by recruited monocytes and other cells that controls infection. How IL-1 directs these cells to produce inflammatory cytokines is unknown. Here, we show that collaboration with the alveolar epithelium is critical for controlling infection. IL-1 induces the alveolar epithelium to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Intriguingly, GM-CSF signaling amplifies inflammatory cytokine production in recruited monocytes by enhancing Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced glycolysis. Our findings reveal that alveolar macrophages engage alveolar epithelial signals to metabolically reprogram monocytes for antibacterial inflammation.},

SMS2 deficiency in macrophages diminishes NFκB and MAP kinase activation induced by inflammatory stimuli. Objective-The effects of SMS2 deficiency on the development of atherosclerosis are investigated. Methods and Results-We measured cholesterol efflux from macrophages of wild type (WT) and SMS2 knockout (KO) mice. We transplanted SMS2 KO mouse bone marrow into LDL receptor knockout mice (SMS2 −/− →LDLr −/−), creating a mouse model of SMS2 deficiency in the macrophages. We found that SMS2 deficiency caused significant induction of cholesterol efflux in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that SMS2 KO mice had less IL-6 and TNFα in the circulation before and after endotoxin stimulation, compared with controls. More importantly, after 3 months on a Western diet, SMS2 −/− →LDLr −/− mice showed decreased atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch, root (57\%, P{$<$}0.001), and the entire aorta (42\%, P{$<$}0.01), compared with WT→LDLr −/− mice. Analysis of plaque morphology revealed that SMS2 −/− →LDLr −/− mice had significantly less necrotic core area (71\%, P{$<$}0.001), less macrophage content (37\%, P{$<$}0.01), and more collagencontent (35\%, P{$<$}0.05) in atherosclerotic lesions. We also found that SMS2 −/− →LDLr −/− mice had significantly lower free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels in the brachiocephalic artery than WT→LDLr −/− ones (33 and 52\%, P{$<$}0.01 and P{$<$}0.001, respectively). Conclusions-SMS2 deficiency in the macrophages reduces atherosclerosis in mice. Macrophage SMS2 is thus a potential therapeutic target for treatment of this disease. Foam cell formation due to excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the macrophages is a pathological hallmark of atherosclerosis, 1 which is also known to be an inflammatory disease. 2 The accumulation of macrophage-derived foam cells in the vessel wall is always accompanied by the production of a wide range of chemokines and cytokines that regulate the turnover and},

Cations such as potassium ion (K(+)), sodium ion (Na(+)) and proton (H(+)) are involved in nearly all aspects of bacterial growth and survival. K(+) is the most abundant cation and its homeostasis in Escherichia coli and Salmonella is regulated by three major K(+) transporters: high affinity transporter Kdp and low affinity transporters Kup and Trk. Previous studies have demonstrated the roles of cations and cation transport in the physiology of Escherichia coli; their roles in the virulence and physiology of pathogenic bacteria are not well characterized. We have previously reported that the Salmonella K(+) transporter Trk is important for the secretion of effector proteins of the type III secretion system (TTSS) of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1). Here we further explore the role of Salmonella cation transport in virulence in vitro and pathogenesis in animal models. Impairment of K(+) transport through deletion of K(+) transporters or exposure to the chemical modulators of cation transport, gramicidin and valinomycin, results in a severe defect in the TTSS of SPI-1, and this defect in the TTSS was not due to a failure to regulate intrabacterial pH or ATP. Our results also show that K(+) transporters are critical to the pathogenesis of Salmonella in mice and chicks and are involved in multiple growth and virulence characteristics in vitro, including protein secretion, motility and invasion of epithelial cells. These results suggest that cation transport of the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella, especially K(+) transport, contributes to its virulence in addition to previously characterized roles in maintaining homeostasis of bacteria.},

  abstract = {Abstract             RSL1D1 (ribosomal L1 domain containing 1), a member of the universal ribosomal protein uL1 family, was suggested to be a new candidate target for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of RSL1D1 in cancer, including CRC, remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrated that RSL1D1 expression was significantly elevated in tumors from CRC patients and that high expression of RSL1D1 was correlated with poorer survival of CRC patients. Functionally, RSL1D1 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells by suppressing autophagy. Interestingly, RSL1D1 interacted with RAN and inhibited its deacetylation by competitively binding with Sirt7. By affecting the acetylation of RAN, RSL1D1 inhibited the accumulation of nuclear STAT3 and the STAT3-regulated autophagic program. Taken together, our study uncovered the key role of the RSL1D1/RAN/STAT3 regulatory axis in autophagy and tumor progression in CRC, providing a new candidate target for CRC treatment.},

  abstract = {Newly emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoVs (MERS-CoV), and H7N9, cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of FcγR reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.},

  abstract = {Resistance to fungal infections is attributed to engagement of host pattern-recognition receptors, notably the β-glucan receptor Dectin-1 and the integrin Mac-1, which induce phagocytosis and antifungal immunity. However, the mechanisms by which these receptors coordinate fungal clearance are unknown. We show that upon ligand binding, Dectin-1 activates Mac-1 to also recognize fungal components, and this stepwise process is critical for neutrophil cytotoxic responses. Both Mac-1 activation and Dectin-1- and Mac-1-induced neutrophil effector functions require Vav1 and Vav3, exchange factors for RhoGTPases. Mac-1- or Vav1,3-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to systemic candidiasis that is not due to impaired neutrophil recruitment but defective intracellular killing of C. albicans yeast forms, and Mac-1 or Vav1,3 reconstitution in hematopoietic cells restores resistance. Our results demonstrate that antifungal immunity depends on Dectin-1-induced activation of Mac-1 functions that is coordinated by Vav proteins, a pathway that may localize cytotoxic responses of circulating neutrophils to infected tissues. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The function of NPC1 is unknown, but when it is dysfunctional, sphingosine, glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin and cholesterol accumulate. We have found that NPC1-mutant cells have a large reduction in the acidic compartment calcium store compared to wild-type cells. Chelating luminal endocytic calcium in normal cells with high-affinity Rhod-dextran induced an NPC disease cellular phenotype. In a drug-induced NPC disease cellular model, sphingosine storage in the acidic compartment led to calcium depletion in these organelles, which then resulted in cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipid storage in these compartments. Sphingosine storage is therefore an initiating factor in NPC1 disease pathogenesis that causes altered calcium homeostasis, leading to the secondary storage of sphingolipids and cholesterol. This unique calcium phenotype represents a new target for therapeutic intervention, as elevation of cytosolic calcium with curcumin normalized NPC1 disease cellular phenotypes and prolonged survival of the NPC1 mouse. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Viruses belonging to the order Herpesvirales are found in many species and all around the world. It is commonly surmised that herpesviruses are species specific and have a relatively long history of coevolution with their respective hosts (Davison 2002). In addition, there are numerous examples where different herpes- viruses have been found in one species. For example, in humans we know nine different herpesviruses that are members of the Alpha- (3), Beta- (4), or Gammaherpesvirinae (2) subfamilies, respectively, in the Herpesviridae family (Davison et al. 2009; Roizman 1996). Although the dogma of species specificity is regularly challenged and has become more and more questionable as we retrieve and analyze more and more virus sequences from animals of different taxa, the nomenclature of the Herpesvirales remains organized such that it reflects the host species from which it is isolated and which is considered the definitive host (Davison et al. 2009). Regardless of nomenclature and species specificities, all herpesviruses share fundamental biological principles. The signature lifestyle of herpesviruses includes phases of lytic replication with the production of fully infectious progeny that are clearly distinct from phases of quiescence, commonly referred to as latency (Arvin et al. 2007). The herpesvirus lifestyle means that “herpesviruses are forever”: once a host is infected, the virus stays with it for prolonged periods of time, yes, we believe for the lifetime of the infected individual (Field et al. 2006; Preston and Efstathiou 2007). While formally this is hard to prove and also challenged from time to time, it is clear that primary infection, latency, and reactivation or recru- descence from the latent state are central to herpesvirus epidemiology and mainte- nance in populations (Bennett and Gilden 1996; Grinde 2013). In this issue of Advances in Anatomy and Embryology, experts in the herpesvi- rus field describe and shed new light on the cellular processes that herpesviruses employ to manipulate host cells for their quest of survival. Being enveloped viruses, herpesviruses attach to the plasma membrane and then enter target cells by fusion (discussed in Chaps. 1 and 2). The next encounter is with the host cell’s innate defenses (Chap. 3), before the nucleocapsid travels to nuclear pores and releases its genome into the nucleus. Here, replication occurs after co-opting and partially v vi Preface disarming antiviral functions in the nucleus (Chap. 4), and new nucleocapsids are formed (Chap. 6), before newly produced virions have to leave the nucleus, which they do by fusion with the inner nuclear membrane (Chap. 7). After de-envelopment at the outer nuclear membrane and loss of the “primary” envelope, the viruses make their way out of the infected cells (Chap. 8), which then allows them to spread to new individuals (Chap. 9). However, as outlined before, in some instances and dependent on the cell type, latency is established after DNA is released into the nucleus, a condition characterized by the presence and mainte- nance of viral genomes but without lytic viral gene expression (Chap. 5). In summary, experts in the herpesvirus field here report on the recent advances in knowledge of interaction between herpesviruses and their target cells. The authors describe their work and that of others and how cell biology, biochemistry, and genetics help us to continuously increase and refine our understanding of the very peculiar pathogen–host interactions.

  abstract = {Sphingolipids (SLs) are chemically diverse lipids that have important structural and signaling functions within mammalian cells. SLs are commonly defined by the presence of a long-chain base (LCB) that is normally formed by the conjugation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. This pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent reaction is mediated by the enzyme serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT). However, SPT can also metabolize other acyl-CoAs, in the range of C14 to C18, forming a variety of LCBs that differ by structure and function. Mammalian SPT consists of three core subunits: SPTLC1, SPTLC2, and SPTLC3. Whereas SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 are ubiquitously expressed, SPTLC3 expression is restricted to certain tissues only. The influence of the individual subunits on enzyme activity is not clear. Using cell models deficient in SPTLC1, SPTLC2, and SPTLC3, we investigated the role of each subunit on enzyme activity and the LCB product spectrum. We showed that SPTLC1 is essential for activity, whereas SPTLC2 and SPTLC3 are partly redundant but differ in their enzymatic properties. SPTLC1 in combination with SPTLC2 specifically formed C18, C19, and C20 LCBs while the combination of SPTLC1 and SPTLC3 yielded a broader product spectrum. We identified anteiso-branched-C18 SO (meC18SO) as the primary product of the SPTLC3 reaction. The meC18SO was synthesized from anteiso-methyl-palmitate, in turn synthesized from a precursor metabolite generated in the isoleucine catabolic pathway. The meC18SO is metabolized to ceramides and complex SLs and is a constituent of human low- and high-density lipoproteins.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Despite remarkable success in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB), it remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Management of TB requires an efficient and timely diagnostic strategy. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the plasma lipidome of TB patients, then selected candidate lipid and lipid-related gene biomarkers using a data-driven, knowledge-based framework. Among 93 lipids that were identified as potential biomarker candidates, ether-linked phosphatidylcholine (PC O–) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were generally upregulated, while free fatty acids and triglycerides with longer fatty acyl chains were downregulated in the TB group. Lipid-related gene enrichment analysis revealed significantly altered metabolic pathways (e.g., ether lipid, linolenic acid, and cholesterol) and immune response signaling pathways. Based on these potential biomarkers, TB patients could be differentiated from controls in the internal validation (random forest model, area under the curve [AUC] 0.936, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.865–0.992). PC(O-40:4), PC(O-42:5), PC(36:0), and PC(34:4) were robust biomarkers able to distinguish TB patients from individuals with latent infection and healthy controls, as shown in the external validation. Small changes in expression were identified for 162 significant lipid-related genes in the comparison of TB patients vs. controls; in the random forest model, their utilities were demonstrated by AUCs that ranged from 0.829 to 0.956 in three cohorts. In conclusion, this study introduced a potential framework that can be used to identify and validate metabolism-centric biomarkers.},

Though the paradigm is that their open structure allows for passive flow of infectious particles from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs, virus applied to skin by scarification does not spread to draining lymph nodes. Using cutaneous infection by scarification, we analyzed the effect of viral infection on lymphatic transport and evaluated its role at the host-pathogen interface. We found that, in the absence of lymphatic vessels, canonical lymph-node-dependent immune induction was impaired, resulting in exacerbated pathology and compensatory, systemic priming. Furthermore, lymphatic vessels decouple fluid and cellular transport in an interferon-dependent manner, leading to viral sequestration while maintaining dendritic cell transport for immune induction. In conclusion, we found that lymphatic vessels balance immune activation and viral dissemination and act as an “innate-like” component of tissue host viral defense. Loo et al. challenge the prevailing view that lymphatic vessels are passive conduits that flush antigen and pathogens to lymphoid tissue. Rather, the authors demonstrate that lymphatic vessels are a selective and active barrier that efficiently coordinates immune activation while also limiting viral spread and subsequent immune pathology.},

The recent observation of differential sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity in normal (low SMS) versus SV40-transformed (high SMS) WI38 human lung fibroblasts provides an opportunity to assess the involvement of ceramide and SMS in NF-kappaB activation. Treatment of normal WI38 fibroblasts with bacterial sphingomyelinase resulted in a 4-fold elevation of ceramide and blocked NF-kappaB activation by serum stimulation. Such inhibition was not observed in SV40-transformed fibroblasts. Under regular growth conditions, after sphingomyelinase was washed out, normal WI38 did not show SM re-synthesis nor NF-kappaB activation. In SV40-WI38, on the other hand, sphingomyelinase washout induced resynthesis of SM due to the action of SMS on ceramide generated at the plasma membrane. NF-kappaB activation correlated with SM resynthesis. This activation was abrogated by D609, which inhibited SM resynthesis but not the initial formation of ceramide. The differential activity of SMS may explain the effects of ceramide in NF-kappaB signaling: in the absence of significant SMS activity, ceramide inhibits NF-kappaB, whereas with high SMS, the conversion of the ceramide signal to a diacylglycerol signal by the action of SMS stimulates NF-kappaB. These results also suggest a role for SMS in regulating NF-kappaB.},

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is a sphingolipid reported to function as a structural component of plasma membranes and to participate in signal transduction. The role of SM metabolism in the process of hearing remains controversial. Here, we examined the role of SM synthase (SMS), which is subcategorized into the family members SMS1 and SMS2, in auditory function. Measurements of auditory brainstem response (ABR) revealed hearing impairment in SMS1-/- mice in a low frequency range (4-16 kHz). As a possible mechanism of this impairment, we found that the stria vascularis (SV) in these mice exhibited atrophy and disorganized marginal cells. Consequently, SMS1-/- mice exhibited significantly smaller endocochlear potentials (EPs). As a possible mechanism for EP reduction, we found altered expression patterns and a reduced level of KCNQ1 channel protein in the SV of SMS1-/- mice. These mice also exhibited reduced levels of distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Quantitative comparison of the SV atrophy, KCNQ1 expression, and outer hair cell density at the cochlear apical and basal turns revealed no location dependence, but more macrophage invasion into the SV was observed in the apical region than the basal region, suggesting a role of cochlear location-dependent oxidative stress in producing the frequency dependence of hearing loss in SMS1-/- mice. Elevated ABR thresholds, decreased EPs, and abnormal KCNQ1 expression patterns in SMS1-/- mice were all found to be progressive with age. Mice lacking SMS2, however, exhibited neither detectable hearing loss nor changes in their EPs. Taken together, our results suggest that hearing impairments occur in SMS1-/- but not SMS2-/- mice.

  abstract = {DC-SIGN (CD209/CLEC4L) is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) that serves as a reliable cell-surface marker of interleukin 4 (IL-4)-activated human macrophages [M(IL-4)], which historically represent the most studied subset within the M2 spectrum of macrophage activation. Although DC-SIGN plays important roles in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) interactions with dendritic cells, its contribution to the Mtb-macrophage interaction remains poorly understood. Since high levels of IL-4 are correlated with tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility and progression, we investigated the role of DC-SIGN in M(IL-4) macrophages in the TB context. First, we demonstrate that DC-SIGN expression is present both in CD68+ macrophages found in tuberculous pulmonary lesions of non-human primates, and in the CD14+ cell population isolated from pleural effusions obtained from TB patients (TB-PE). Likewise, we show that DC-SIGN expression is accentuated in M(IL-4) macrophages derived from peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes isolated from TB patients, or in macrophages stimulated with acellular TB-PE, arguing for the pertinence of DC-SIGN-expressing macrophages in TB. Second, using a siRNA-mediated gene silencing approach, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of DC-SIGN-depleted M(IL-4) macrophages and revealed the upregulation of pro-inflammatory signals in response to challenge with Mtb, as compared to control cells. This pro-inflammatory gene signature was confirmed by RT-qPCR, cytokine/chemokine-based protein array, and ELISA analyses. We also found that inactivation of DC-SIGN renders M(IL-4) macrophages less permissive to Mtb intracellular growth compared to control cells, despite the equal level of bacteria uptake. Last, at the molecular level, we show that DC-SIGN interferes negatively with the pro-inflammatory response and control of Mtb intracellular growth mediated by another CLR, Dectin-1 (CLEC7A). Collectively, this study highlights a dual role for DC-SIGN as, on the one hand, being a host factor granting advantage for Mtb to parasitize macrophages and, on the other hand, representing a molecular switch to turn offthe pro-inflammatory response in these cells to prevent potential immunopathology associated to TB.},

Likewise, there have been significant advances in dissecting the mechanisms involved in the microbial subversion of MPS cells, mainly affecting their differentiation and effector functions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial pathogen that represents an enigma to the field because of its remarkable ability to thrive in humans. One reason is that M. tuberculosis renders a defective MPS compartment, which is perhaps the most ingenious strategy for survival in the host given the prominence of these cells to modulate microenvironments, their function as sentinels and orchestrators of the immune response, and their pathogenic role as reservoirs for microbial persistence. In this article, the principal strategies used by M. tuberculosis to subvert the MPS compartment are presented along with emerging concepts.},

  abstract = {The human monocytic cell line, THP-1, is the most widely used model for primary human monocytes/macrophages. This is because, following differentiation using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), THP-1 cells acquire a macrophage-like phenotype, which mimics, in many respects, primary human macrophages. Despite the widespread use of THP-1 cells in studies elucidating macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli, as well as the development and screening of potential therapeutics, there is currently no standardised protocol for the reliable differentiation of THP-1 monocytes to a macrophage phenotype using PMA. Consequently, reports using THP-1 cells have demonstrated significant phenotypic and functional differences between resultant THP-1 macrophage populations, which are largely attributable to the varying PMA differentiation methods used. Thus, to guarantee consistency and reproducibility between studies, and to ensure the relevance of THP-1 cells as an appropriate model for primary human macrophages, it is crucial to develop a standardised protocol for the differentiation of THP-1 macrophages. Accordingly, we compared the function and phenotype of THP-1 macrophages generated using the range of published PMA differentiation protocols, specifically in response to the pro-inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our results demonstrated that the function of the resultant THP-1 macrophage populations, as determined by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) secretion in response to LPS stimulation, varied significantly, and was dependent upon the concentration of PMA used to stimulate the differentiation of monocytes, and the period of rest following PMA exposure. These data indicate that exposure of monocytic THP-1 cells to 25 nM PMA over 48 h, followed by a recovery period of 24 h in culture in the absence of PMA, was the optimal protocol for the differentiation of THP-1 cells.},

  abstract = {Egress of wrapped virus (WV) to the cell periphery following vaccinia virus (VACV) replication is dependent on interactions with the microtubule motor complex kinesin-1 and is mediated by the viral envelope protein A36. Here we report that ectromelia virus (ECTV), a related orthopoxvirus and the causative agent of mousepox, encodes an A36 homologue (ECTV-Mos-142) that is highly conserved despite a large truncation at the C terminus. Deleting the ECTV A36R gene leads to a reduction in the number of extracellular viruses formed and to a reduced plaque size, consistent with a role in microtubule transport. We also observed a complete loss of virus-associated actin comets, another phenotype dependent on A36 expression during VACV infection. ECTV ΔA36R was severely attenuated when used to infect the normally susceptible BALB/c mouse strain. ECTV ΔA36R replication and spread from the draining lymph nodes to the liver and spleen were significantly reduced in BALB/c mice and in Rag-1-deficient mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. The dramatic reduction in ECTV ΔA36R titers early during the course of infection was not associated with an augmented immune response. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the critical role that subcellular transport pathways play not only in orthopoxvirus infection in an in vitro context but also during orthopoxvirus pathogenesis in a natural host. Furthermore, despite the attenuation of the mutant virus, we found that infection nonetheless induced protective immunity in mice, suggesting that orthopoxvirus vectors with A36 deletions may be considered another safe vaccine alternative.},

  abstract = {Successful host colonization by bacteria requires sensing and response to the local ionic milieu, and coordination of responses with the maintenance of ionic homeostasis in the face of changing conditions. We previously discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) responds synergistically to chloride (Cl-) and pH, as cues to the immune status of its host. This raised the intriguing concept of abundant ions as important environmental signals, and we have now uncovered potassium (K+) as an ion that can significantly impact colonization by Mtb. The bacterium has a unique transcriptional response to changes in environmental K+ levels, with both distinct and shared regulatory mechanisms controlling Mtb response to the ionic signals of K+, Cl-, and pH. We demonstrate that intraphagosomal K+ levels increase during macrophage phagosome maturation, and find using a novel fluorescent K+-responsive reporter Mtb strain that K+ is not limiting during macrophage infection. Disruption of Mtb K+ homeostasis by deletion of the Trk K+ uptake system results in dampening of the bacterial response to pH and Cl-, and attenuation in host colonization, both in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and in vivo in a murine model of Mtb infection. Our study reveals how bacterial ionic homeostasis can impact environmental ionic responses, and highlights the important role that abundant ions can play during host colonization by Mtb.},

The D4H probe disassociates from the plasma membrane upon cholesterol extraction and after perturbations in cellular cholesterol trafficking. When used in combination with a recombinant version of the biosensor, we show that plasmalemmal phosphatidylserine is essential for retaining cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. In vitro experiments reveal that 1-stearoy-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine can induce phase separation in cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers and shield cholesterol from cholesterol oxidase. Finally, the altered transbilayer distribution of cholesterol causes flotillin-1 to relocalize to endocytic organelles. This probe should be useful in the future to study pools of cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane and organelles.},

  abstract = {The biochemical composition and biophysical properties of cell membranes are hypothesized to affect cellular processes such as phagocytosis. Here, we examined the plasma membranes of murine macrophage cell lines during the early stages of uptake of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-coated polystyrene particles. We found that the plasma membrane undergoes rapid actin-independent condensation to form highly ordered phagosomal membranes, the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts. Surprisingly, these membranes are depleted of cholesterol and enriched in sphingomyelin and ceramide. Inhibition of sphingomyelinase activity impairs membrane condensation, F-actin accumulation at phagocytic cups and particle uptake. Switching phagosomal membranes to a cholesterol-rich environment had no effect on membrane condensation and the rate of phagocytosis. In contrast, preventing membrane condensation with the oxysterol 7-ketocholesterol, even in the presence of ceramide, blocked F-actin dissociation from nascent phagosomes and particle uptake. In conclusion, our results suggest that ordered membranes function to co-ordinate F-actin remodelling and that the biophysical properties of phagosomal membranes are essential for phagocytosis. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

To determine factors leading to Mtb proliferation and host cell death, we used live cell imaging to track Mtb infection outcomes in individual primary human macrophages. Internalization of Mtb aggregates caused macrophage death, and phagocytosis of large aggregates was more cytotoxic than multiple small aggregates containing similar numbers of bacilli. Macrophage death did not result in clearance of Mtb. Rather, it led to accelerated intracellular Mtb growth regardless of prior activation or macrophage type. In contrast, bacillary replication was controlled in live phagocytes. Mtb grew as a clump in dead cells, and macrophages which internalized dead infected cells were very likely to die themselves, leading to a cell death cascade. This demonstrates how pathogen virulence can be achieved through numbers and aggregation states.},

  abstract = {This volume aims to describe a variety of techniques that reflects the wide range of research currently performed in the field of coronavirology, and begins with an overview of current understandings of coronavirus replication and pathogenesis to introduce specialists and non-specialists to the field. The rest of the book is divided into several sections of chapters beginning with those that describe identification, diagnosis, and study of the evolution of coronaviruses. The next few chapters discuss the preparation of cells and organ cultures useful in propagating coronaviruses and titration techniques, as well as techniques for analyzing virus functions that require purification of the viruses. The next chapters describe two commonly used reverse genetics techniques for coronaviruses, and techniques detailing identification of cellular receptors, binding profiles of viral attachment proteins, and virus-cell fusion. The final chapters cover a broad spectrum of techniques to identify virus-host protein-protein interactions, confirm the functional role of these proteins in virus replication, study host cell responses through genome-wide or pathway-specific approaches, and visualize virus replication complexes. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, the chapters include the kind of detailed description and implementation advice that is crucial for getting optimal results in the laboratory. Authoritative and practical, Coronaviruses: Methods and Protocols appeals to a wide variety of scientists because it highlights techniques that are currently used in the coronovirology field, while also discussing practices applicable to other virology fields.},

MATERIALS \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; METHOD Adults H. diminuta were collected from urban rats in Tehran, Iran. The beetles became infected using blended gravid segments with flour as bait. Cysticercoids have been saved after precise dissection of invertebrate hosts. The exposure of infected beetles to laboratory rats was performed to establish the life cycle. RESULT Out of 57 collected rats, three rats were infected with H. diminuta. Almost all exposed beetles found infected with the larval stage of parasite. About one-month later H. diminuta eggs were seen in stool examination of laboratory rats. CONCLUSION Rare human occurrence of H. diminuta along with light level of clinical manifestation of this parasite, underestimate the concerns toward its public health importance. Nowadays, various field of studies, such as biochemistry with special focuses on the capability of H. diminuta tegument absorption have performed apart from parasitological views alone. In the present study, establishment of this parasite life cycle has practically provided the access of adult and cysticercoid stages of the tapeworm in further researches.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase plays a key role in host defense against pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. Zymosan a cell-wall preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is largely used to activate neutrophils in its opsonized form. In this study, we show that non-opsonized zymosan alone induced ROS production by human neutrophils. Zymosan-induced ROS production is higher than the formyl-methionyl-leucyl- phenylalanine (fMLF)- or the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced ROS production but is lower than the one induced by opsonized zymosan. Most of the zymosan-induced ROS production is intracellular. Interestingly, zymosan induced the phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p47phox on several sites which are Ser315, Ser328 and Ser345. Zymosan induced also the activation of the small G-protein Rac2. Phosphorylation of the p47phox as well as Rac2 activation were inhibited by genistein a broad range protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and by wortmannin a PI3Kinase inhibitor. GF109203X a PKC inhibitor inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser315 and Ser328. SB203580 and UO126, inhibitors of p38MAPK and ERK1/2-pathway, respectively, inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser345. Zymosan-induced ROS production was completely inhibited by genistein and wortmannin and partially inhibited by SB203580, UO126 and GF109203X. These results show that zymosan alone is able to activate NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils via the phosphorylation of p47phox and Rac2 activation and that a protein tyrosine kinase, PI3Kinase, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and PKC are involved in this process. These pathways could be potential pharmacological targets to treat zymosan- and S. cerevisiae-induced inflammation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and three million people die of tuberculosis each year. Following its ingestion by macrophages (MPs), Mtb inhibits the maturation of its phagosome, preventing progression to a bactericidal phagolysosome. Phagocytosis of Mtb is uncoupled from the elevation in MP cytosolic Ca(2+) that normally accompanies microbial ingestion, resulting in inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion and increased intracellular viability. This study demonstrates that the mechanism responsible for this failure of Ca(2+)-dependent phagosome maturation involves mycobacterial inhibition of MP sphingosine kinase. Thus, inhibition of sphingosine kinase directly contributes to survival of Mtb within human MPs and represents a novel molecular mechanism of pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Complement receptor (CR)-mediated phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by macrophages results in intracellular survival, suggesting that M. tuberculosis interferes with macrophage microbicidal mechanisms. As increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) promote phagocyte antimicrobial responses, we hypothesized that CR phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis is accompanied by altered Ca2+ signaling. Whereas the control complement (C)-opsonized particle zymosan (COZ) induced a 4.6-fold increase in [Ca2+]c in human macrophages, no change in [Ca2+]c occurred upon addition of live, C-opsonized virulent M. tuberculosis. Viability of M. tuberculosis and ingestion via CRs was required for infection of macrophages in the absence of increased [Ca2+]c, as killed M. tuberculosis or antibody (Ab)-opsonized, live M. tuberculosis induced elevations in [Ca2+]c similar to COZ. Increased [Ca2+]c induced by Ab-opsonized bacilli was associated with a 76\% reduction in intracellular survival, compared with C-opsonized M. tuberculosis. Similarly, reversible elevation of macrophage [Ca2+]c with the ionophore A23187 reduced intracellular viability by 50\%. Ionophore-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]c promoted the maturation of phagosomes containing live C-opsonized bacilli, as evidenced by acidification and accumulation of lysosomal protein markers. These data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis inhibits CR-mediated Ca2+ signaling and indicate that this alteration of macrophage activation contributes to inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion and promotion of intracellular mycobacterial survival.\textbackslash n},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mycobacterium tuberculosis successfully parasitizes macrophages by disrupting the maturation of its phagosome, creating an intracellular compartment with endosomal rather than lysosomal characteristics. We have recently demonstrated that live M. tuberculosis infect human macrophages in the absence of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c), which correlates with inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion and intracellular viability. In contrast, killed M. tuberculosis induces an elevation in [Ca2+]c that is coupled to phagosome-lysosome fusion. We tested the hypothesis that defective activation of the Ca2+-dependent effector proteins calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) contributes to the intracellular pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Phagosomes containing live M. tuberculosis exhibited decreased levels of CaM and the activated form of CaMKII compared with phagosomes encompassing killed tubercle bacilli. Furthermore, ionophore-induced elevations in [Ca2+]c resulted in recruitment of CaM and activation of CaMKII on phagosomes containing live M. tuberculosis. Specific inhibitors of CaM or CaMKII blocked Ca2+ ionophore-induced phagosomal maturation and enhanced the bacilli’s intracellular viability. These results demonstrate a novel role for CaM and CaMKII in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion and suggest that defective activation of these Ca2+-activated signaling components contributes to the successful parasitism of human macrophages by M. tuberculosis.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Elimination of fungal pathogens by phagocytes requires phagosome maturation, a process that involves the recruitment and fusion of intracellular proteins. The role of Dectin-1, a β-1,3-glucan receptor, critical for fungal recognition and triggering of Th17 responses, to phagosomal maturation has not been defined. We show that GFP-Dectin-1 translocates to the fungal phagosome, but its signal decays after 2 h. Inhibition of acidification results in retention of GFP-Dectin-1 to phagosome membranes highlighting the requirement for an acidic pH. Following β-1,3-glucan recognition, GFP-Dectin-1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases with subsequent Syk activation. Our results demonstrate that Syk is activated independently of intraphagosomal pH. Inhibition of Src or Syk results in prolonged retention of GFP-Dectin-1 to the phagosome signifying a link between Syk and intraphagosomal pH. β-1,3-glucan phagosomes expressing a signaling incompetent Dectin-1 failed to mature as demonstrated by prolonged Dectin-1 retention, presence of Rab5B, failure to acquire LAMP-1 and inability to acidify. Phagosomes containing Candida albicans also require Dectin-1-dependent Syk activation for phagosomal maturation. Taken together, these results support a model where Dectin-1 not only controls internalization of β-1,3-glucan containing cargo and triggers proinflammatory cytokines, but also acts as a master regulator for subsequent phagolysosomal maturation through Syk activation.},

This evidence has come from several whole-genome linkage scans, and numerous case-control association studies where the candidate genes were derived from the genome screens, animal models and hypotheses pertaining to the disease pathways. Although many of the associated genes have not been validated in all studies, the list of those that have been is growing, and includes NRAMP1, IFNG, NOS2A, MBL, VDR and some TLR. Certain of these genes have consistently been associated with tuberculosis in diverse populations. The future investigation of susceptibility to tuberculosis is almost certain to include genome-wide association studies, admixture mapping and the search for rare variants and epigenetic mechanisms. The genetic identification of more vulnerable individuals is expected to inform personalized treatment and perhaps vaccination strategies.},

  abstract = {Ceramide, an emerging bioactive lipid and second messenger, is mainly generated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin through the action of sphingomyelinases. At least two sphingomyelinases, neutral and acid sphingo myelinases, are activated in response to many extracellular stimuli. Despite extensive studies, the precise cellular function of each of these sphingomyelinases in sphingomyelin turnover and in the regulation of ceramide-mediated responses is not well understood. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the factors and mechanisms that control the activation of acid and neutral sphingomyelinases to understand their the roles in cell regulation. This review will focus on the molecular mechanisms that regulate these enzymes in vivo and in vitro, especially the roles of oxidants (glu ta thi one, peroxide, nitric oxide), proteins (saposin, caveolin 1, caspases), and lipids (diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and ceramide).Key words: sphingomyelinase, ceramide, apoptosis, Niemann-Pick disease, FAN (factor associated with N-SMase activation).}

  abstract = {Neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) is one of the key enzymes involved in the generation of ceramide; however, the gene(s) encoding for the mammalian N-SMase is still not well defined. Previous studies on the cloned nSMase1 had shown that the protein acts primarily as lyso-platelet-activating factor-phospholipase C. Recently the cloning of another putative N-SMase, nSMase2, was reported. In this study, biochemical characterization of the mouse nSMase2 was carried out using the overexpressed protein in yeast cells in which the inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (Isc1p) was deleted. N-SMase activity was dependent on Mg2+ and was activated by phosphatidylserine and inhibited by GW4869. The ability of nSMase2 to recognize endogenous sphingomyelin (SM) as substrate was investigated by overexpressing nSMase2 in MCF7 cells. Mass measurements showed a 40\% decrease in the SM levels in the overexpressor cells, and labeling studies demonstrated that nSMase2 accelerated SM catabolism. Accordingly, ceramide measurement showed a 60 +/- 15\% increase in nSMase2-overexpressing cells compared with the vector-transfected MCF7. The role of nSMase2 in cell growth was next investigated. Stable overexpression of nSMase2 resulted in a 30-40\% decrease in the rate of growth at the late exponential phase. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor induced similar to50\% activation of nSMase2 in MCF7 cells overexpressing the enzyme, demonstrating that nSMase2 is a tumor necrosis factor-responsive enzyme. In conclusion, these results 1) show that nSMase2 is a structural gene for nSMase, 2) suggest that nSMase2 acts as a bona fide N-SMase in cells, and 3) implicate nSMase2 in the regulation of cell growth and cell signaling},

However, development of analytical methods has lagged behind. Here we describe an empirical Bayes framework for quantitative proteomics data analysis. The method provides a statistical description of each experiment, including the number of proteins that differ in abundance between 2 samples, the experiment's statistical power to detect them, and the false-positive probability of each protein. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed 2 types of mass spectrometric experiments. First, we showed that the method identified the protein targets of small-molecules in affinity purification experiments with high precision. Second, we re-analyzed a mass spectrometric data set designed to identify proteins regulated by microRNAs. Our results were supported by sequence analysis of the 3' UTR regions of predicted target genes, and we found that the previously reported conclusion that a large fraction of the proteome is regulated by microRNAs was not supported by our statistical analysis of the data. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results highlight the importance of rigorous statistical analysis of proteomic data, and the method described here provides a statistical framework to robustly and reliably interpret such data.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is a highly localized and rapid event, requiring the generation of spatially and temporally restricted signals. Because phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) plays an important role in the innate immune response, we studied the generation and distribution of 3′ phosphoinositides (3′PIs) in macrophages during the course of phagocytosis. The presence of 3′PI was monitored noninvasively in cells transfected with chimeras of green fluorescent protein and the pleckstrin homology domain of either Akt, Btk, or Gab1. Although virtually undetectable in unstimulated cells, 3′PI rapidly accumulated at sites of phagocytosis. This accumulation was sharply restricted to the phagosomal cup, with little 3′PI detectable in the immediately adjacent areas of the plasmalemma. Measurements of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching were made to estimate the mobility of lipids in the cytosolic monolayer of the phagosomal membrane. Stimulation of phagocytic receptors induced a marked reduction of lipid mobility that likely contributes to the restricted distribution of 3′PI at the cup. 3′PI accumulation during phagocytosis was transient, terminating shortly after sealing of the phagosomal vacuole. Two factors contribute to the rapid disappearance of 3′PI: the dissociation of the type I PI3K from the phagosomal membrane and the persistent accumulation of phosphoinositide phosphatases.},

  abstract = {The granuloma is the defining feature of the host response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Despite knowing of its existence for centuries, much remains unclear regarding the host and bacterial factors that contribute to granuloma formation, heterogeneity of presentation, and the forces at play within. Mtb is highly adapted to life within the granuloma and employs many unique strategies to both create a niche within the host as well as survive the stresses imposed upon it. Adding to the complexity of the granuloma is the vast range of pathology observed, often within the same individual. Here, we explore some of the many ways in which Mtb crafts the immune response to its liking and builds a variety of granuloma features that contribute to its survival. We also consider the multitude of ways that Mtb is adapted to life in the granuloma and how variability in the deployment of these strategies may result in different fates for both the bacterium and the host. It is through better understanding of these complex interactions that we may begin to strategize novel approaches for tuberculosis treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Infection with               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               causes a spectrum of outcomes; the majority of individuals contain but do not eliminate the infection, while a small subset present with primary active tuberculosis (TB) disease. This variability in infection outcomes is recapitulated at the granuloma level within each host, such that some sites of infection can be fully cleared while others progress. Understanding the spectrum of TB outcomes requires new tools to deconstruct the mechanisms underlying differences in granuloma fate. Here, we use novel genome-encoded barcodes to uniquely tag individual               M.~tuberculosis               bacilli, enabling us to quantitatively track the trajectory of each infecting bacterium in a macaque model of TB. We also introduce a robust bioinformatics pipeline capable of identifying and counting barcode sequences within complex mixtures and at various read depths. By coupling this tagging strategy with serial positron emission tomography coregistered with computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging of lung pathology in macaques, we define a lesional map of               M.~tuberculosis               infection dynamics. We find that there is no significant infection bottleneck, but there are significant constraints on productive bacterial trafficking out of primary granulomas. Our findings validate our barcoding approach and demonstrate its utility in probing lesion-specific biology and dissemination. This novel technology has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of local dynamics in tuberculosis.                                         IMPORTANCE               Classically,               M.~tuberculosis               infection was thought to result in either latent infection or active disease. More recently, the field has recognized that there is a spectrum of               M.~tuberculosis               infection clinical outcomes. Within a single host, this spectrum is recapitulated at the granuloma level, where there can simultaneously be lesional sterilization and poorly contained disease. To better understand the lesional biology of TB infection, we digitally barcoded               M.~tuberculosis               to quantitatively track the fate of each infecting bacterium. By combining this technology with serial PET-CT imaging, we can dynamically track both bacterial populations and granuloma trajectories. We demonstrate that there is little constraint on the bacterial population at the time of infection. However, the granuloma imposes a strong bottleneck on dissemination, and the subset of granulomas at risk of dissemination can be distinguished by physical features.                        ,              IMPORTANCE                            Classically,               M.~tuberculosis               infection was thought to result in either latent infection or active disease.

  abstract = {The human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line can be induced to differentiate to neutrophil-like cells in response to a variety of chemical stimuli. We have found that retinoic acid-treatment of HL-60 cells over a period of 6-8 days resulted in a progressive increase in the proportion of cells with mature neutrophil morphologies and was closely followed by an increase in the proportion of cells exhibiting the morphological characteristics of apoptosis, the non-pathological mode of cell death. Using Percoll step-density gradients we have demonstrated a marked increase in the buoyant density of these cells and have used this density difference to obtain enriched fractions of cells for more detailed study. Degradation of the nuclear DNA of these cells into integer multiples of about 200 base pairs, indicative of endogenous endonuclease activation a major characteristic of programmed cell death, was also demonstrated. From these observations we conclude that the mode of cell death in cultures of terminally differentiated HL-60 cells is that of apoptosis. These results parallel those of a recent report which has shown apoptosis to be the mode of cell death of ageing peripheral blood neutrophils. Because of this, we believe that our observations further validate the use of the HL-60 cell line as a model system for the study of human granulopoiesis in vitro and further, that this model system may be useful for gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms involved in apoptosis.},

Although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e.g. analysis of variance (ANOVA)] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. RESULTS We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of LC-MS runs with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (run-by-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy. Simulation studies also suggest that this strategy significantly outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs.

Imbalances in the composition of the bacterial microbiota, known as dysbiosis, are postulated to be a major factor in human disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We report here that the prominent human symbiont Bacteroides fragilis protects animals from experimental colitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus, a commensal bacterium with pathogenic potential. This beneficial activity requires a single microbial molecule (polysaccharide A, PSA). In animals harbouring B. fragilis not expressing PSA, H. hepaticus colonization leads to disease and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in colonic tissues. Purified PSA administered to animals is required to suppress pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 production by intestinal immune cells and also inhibits in vitro reactions in cell cultures. Furthermore, PSA protects from inflammatory disease through a functional requirement for interleukin-10-producing CD4+ T cells. These results show that molecules of the bacterial microbiota can mediate the critical balance between health and disease. Harnessing the immunomodulatory capacity of symbiosis factors such as PSA might potentially provide therapeutics for human inflammatory disorders on the basis of entirely novel biological principles.},

Mitochondrial apoptosis is mediated by BAK and BAX, two proteins that induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to cytochrome c release and activation of apoptotic caspases. In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) triggers the innate immune cGAS/STING pathway, causing dying cells to secrete type I interferon. How cGAS gains access to mtDNA remains unclear. We used live-cell lattice light-sheet microscopy to examine the mitochondrial network in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that after BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome c loss, the mitochondrial network broke down and large BAK/BAX pores appeared in the outer membrane.

Apoptotic caspases did not prevent herniation but dismantled the dying cell to suppress mtDNA-induced innate immune signaling.},

  abstract = {During viral infection, proper regulation of immune responses is necessary to ensure successful viral clearance with minimal host tissue damage. Proteasomes play a crucial role in the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation on MHC class I molecules, and thus activation of CD8 T cells, as well as activation of the NF-κB pathway. A specialized type of proteasome called the immunoproteasome is constitutively expressed in hematopoietic cells and induced in non-immune cells during viral infection by interferon signaling. The immunoproteasome regulates CD8 T cell responses to many viral epitopes during infection. Accumulating evidence suggests that the immunoproteasome may also contribute to regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, activation of the NF-κB pathway, and management of oxidative stress. Many viruses have mechanisms of interfering with immunoproteasome function, including prevention of transcriptional upregulation of immunoproteasome components as well as direct interaction of viral proteins with immunoproteasome subunits. A better understanding of the role of the immunoproteasome in different cell types, tissues, and hosts has the potential to improve vaccine design and facilitate the development of effective treatment strategies for viral infections.},

A functional ASM participated in the killing activity of macrophages against wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The role of ASM in early macrophage killing of Salmonella appears to be linked to an active NADPH phagocyte oxidase enzymatic complex, since the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium not only blocked a productive respiratory burst but also abrogated the survival advantage of Salmonella in macrophages lacking ASM. Lack of ASM activity also increased the intracellular survival of an isogenic DeltaspiC::FRT Salmonella strain deficient in a translocator and effector of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity associated with ASM is manifested regardless of the SPI2 status of the bacteria. Constitutively expressed ASM is responsible for the role that this lipid-metabolizing hydrolase plays in the innate host defense of macrophages against Salmonella. Accordingly, the ASM activity and intracellular concentration and composition of ceramide, gangliosides, and neutral sphingolipids did not increase upon Salmonella infection. Salmonella triggered, nonetheless, a significant increase in the secreted fraction of ASM. Collectively, these findings have elucidated a novel role for constitutive ASM in the anti-Salmonella activity of murine macrophages.},

  abstract = {Despite its noted ability to induce strong cellular immunity, and its known susceptibility to IFN-γ-dependent immune effector mechanisms, the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a highly successful parasite, able to replicate, disseminate, and either kill the host or, more commonly, establish resistant encysted life forms before the emergence of protective immune responses. We sought to understand how the parasite gains the advantage. Using transgenic clonal parasite lines engineered to express fluorescent markers in combination with dendritic cells (DC) grown from the bone marrow of wild-type mice or transgenic mice expressing fluorescent protein-tagged MHC class II molecules, we used flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to analyze the responses of infected DC to both invasion by the parasite and subsequent DC maturation signals. We found that T. gondii preferentially invades immature dendritic cells but fails to activate them in the process, and renders them resistant to subsequent activation by TLR ligands of the immune-system-intrinsic maturation signal CD40L. The functional consequences of T. gondii-mediated suppression of DC activation are manifested in a relative inability of infected immature DC to activate naive CD4 + Th lymphocytes, or to secrete cytokines, such IL-12 and TNF-α, that play important roles in innate and/or adaptive immunity. The findings reveal that T. gondii suppresses the ability of immature DC to participate in innate immunity and to induce adaptive immune responses. The ability of T. gondii to temporarily evade recognition could provide a selective advantage that permits dissemination and establishment before adaptive immune response initiation.},

The different class determinants examined were those on plasmids RP1 (class A), R222 (class B), R144 (class C), and RA1 (class D). This decrease in accumulation was attributable to an active efflux, because everted (inside-out) membrane vesicles made from tetracycline-induced E. coli cells containing any one of the four plasmids were shown to concentrate tetracycline by an active influx. This active uptake was not seen in inside-out vesicles from sensitive cells or uninduced R222-containing cells. In vesicles from induced R222-containing cells, the efflux appeared to be carrier-mediated with a Km of about 6 microM. These results demonstrate that active export of tetracycline is a common component of the mechanism for tetracycline resistance encoded by different plasmid-borne determinants in bacteria.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids are ubiquitous membrane constituents whose metabolites function as signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a key sphingolipid second messenger, regulates proliferation, motility, invasiveness, and programmed cell death. These effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate and similar phosphorylated sphingoid bases have been observed in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. Intracellular levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate are tightly regulated by the actions of sphingosine kinase, which is responsible for its synthesis and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase and sphingosine phosphate lyase, the two enzymes responsible for its catabolism. In this study, we describe the cloning of the Caenorhabditis elegans sphingosine phosphate lyase gene along with its functional expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Promoter analysis indicates tissue-specific and developmental regulation of sphingosine phosphate lyase gene expression. Inhibition of C. elegans sphingosine phosphate lyase expression by RNA interference causes accumulation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated long-chain bases and leads to poor feeding, delayed growth, reproductive abnormalities, and intestinal damage similar to the effects seen with exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis toxin. Our results show that sphingosine phosphate lyase is an essential gene in C. elegans and suggest that the sphingolipid degradative pathway plays a conserved role in regulating animal development.},

Using U937 human monocytic leukemia cells, we examined the ability of D609 to inhibit sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), since inhibition of SMS may contribute to D609-induced tumor cell cytotoxicity via modulating the cellular levels of ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG). The results showed that D609 is capable of inducing U937 cell death by apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The induction of U937 cell apoptosis was associated with an inhibition of SMS activity and a significant increase in the intracellular level of ceramide and decrease in that of sphingomyelin (SM) and DAG, which resulted in an elevation of the ratio between ceramide and DAG favoring the induction of apoptosis. In addition, incubation of U937 cells with C 6-ceramide and/or H7 (a selective PKC inhibitor) reduced U937 cell viability; whereas pretreatment of the cells with a PKC activator, PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), attenuated D609-induced U937 cell apoptosis. These results suggest that SMS is a potential target of D609 and inhibition of SMS may contribute to D609-induced tumor cell death via modulation of the cellular levels of ceramide and DAG. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

However,               Caenorhabditis elegans               has developed the ability to survive anoxia for at least 48 hours. Mutations in the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like signaling pathway promote such survival. We describe a pathway involving the HYL-2 ceramide synthase that acts independently of DAF-2. Loss of the ceramide synthase gene               hyl-2               results in increased sensitivity of               C. elegans               to anoxia.

  abstract = {Labeling of primary amines on peptides with reagents containing stable isotopes is a commonly used technique in quantitative mass spectrometry. Isobaric labeling techniques such as iTRAQ™ or TMT™ allow for relative quantification of peptides based on ratios of reporter ions in the low m/z region of spectra produced by precursor ion fragmentation. In contrast, nonisobaric labeling with mTRAQ™ yields precursors with different masses that can be directly quantified in MS1 spectra. In this study, we compare iTRAQ- and mTRAQ-based quantification of peptides and phosphopeptides derived from EGF-stimulated HeLa cells. Both labels have identical chemical structures, therefore precursor ion- and fragment ion-based quantification can be directly compared. Our results indicate that iTRAQ labeling has an additive effect on precursor intensities, whereas mTRAQ labeling leads to more redundant MS2 scanning events caused by triggering on the same peptide with different mTRAQ labels. We found that iTRAQ labeling quantified nearly threefold more phosphopeptides (12,129 versus 4,448) and nearly twofold more proteins (2,699 versus 1,597) than mTRAQ labeling. Although most key proteins in the EGFR signaling network were quantified with both techniques, iTRAQ labeling allowed quantification of twice as many kinases. Accuracy of reporter ion quantification by iTRAQ is adversely affected by peptides that are cofragmented in the same precursor isolation window, dampening observed ratios toward unity. However, because of tighter overall iTRAQ ratio distributions, the percentage of statistically significantly regulated phosphopeptides and proteins detected by iTRAQ and mTRAQ was similar. We observed a linear correlation of logarithmic iTRAQ to mTRAQ ratios over two orders of magnitude, indicating a possibility to correct iTRAQ ratios by an average compression factor. Spike-in experiments using peptides of defined ratios in a background of nonregulated peptides show that iTRAQ quantification is less accurate but not as variable as mTRAQ quantification.},

Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Here we present an optimized workflow for global proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of tissues or cell lines that uses isobaric tags (TMT (tandem mass tags)-10) for multiplexed analysis and relative quantification, and provides 3× higher throughput than iTRAQ (isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification)-4-based methods with high intra-and inter-laboratory reproducibility. The workflow was systematically characterized and benchmarked across three independent laboratories using two distinct breast cancer subtypes from patient-derived xenograft models to enable assessment of proteome and phosphoproteome depth and quantitative reproducibility. Each plex consisted of ten samples, each being 300 μg of peptide derived from {$<$}50 mg of wet-weight tissue. Of the 10,000 proteins quantified per sample, we could distinguish 7,700 human proteins derived from tumor cells and 3100 mouse proteins derived from the surrounding stroma and blood. The maximum deviation across replicates and laboratories was {$<$}7\%, and the inter-laboratory correlation for TMT ratio-based comparison of the two breast cancer subtypes was r {$>$} 0.88. The maximum deviation for the phosphoproteome coverage was {$<$}24\% across laboratories, with an average of {$>$}37,000 quantified phosphosites per sample and differential quantification correlations of r {$>$} 0.72. The full procedure, including sample processing and data generation, can be completed within 10 d for ten tissue samples, and 100 samples can be analyzed in \textasciitilde 4 months using a single LC-MS/MS instrument. The high quality, depth, and reproducibility of the data obtained both within and across laboratories should enable new biological insights to be obtained from mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses of cells and tissues together with proteogenomic data integration.},

Here, we study microbiomes of isolated sea spray aerosol (SSA) collected in a unique ocean–atmosphere facility and demonstrate taxon-specific aerosolization of bacteria and viruses. These trends are conserved within taxonomic orders and classes, and temporal variation in aerosolization is similarly shared by related taxa. We observe enhanced transfer into SSA of Actinobacteria, certain Gammaproteobacteria, and lipid-enveloped viruses; conversely, Flavobacteriia, some Alphaproteobacteria, and               Caudovirales               are generally under-represented in SSA. Viruses do not transfer to SSA as efficiently as bacteria. The enrichment of mycolic acid-coated Corynebacteriales and lipid-enveloped viruses (inferred from genomic comparisons) suggests that hydrophobic properties increase transport to the sea surface and SSA. Our results identify taxa relevant to atmospheric processes and a framework to further elucidate aerosolization mechanisms influencing microbial and viral transport pathways.},

Identification of patients infected with multiple strains provides both insight into the disease dynamics and the epidemiology of tuberculosis. Analysis of Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable-Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting multiple               M. tuberculosis               strains even in sputum. The goal of this study was to identify cases of multiple               M. tuberculosis               strain infections among patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in Southwestern Uganda and assessment of factors associated with multiple strain infections. DNA extracted directly from 78 sputum samples, each from an individual patient, was analyzed using the standard 24 loci MIRU-VNTR typing. Five (6.4\%) of the 78 patients were infected with multiple strains of               M. tuberculosis               with all of them being the newly diagnosed cases while two-thirds of them were co-infected with HIV. Exact regression analysis projected that the natives were more likely to harbor multiple strains (OR; 0.981, 95\% CI 0–7.926) as well as those with a high microbial load (OR; 0.390, 95\% CI 0–3.8167). Despite these findings being not statistically significant due to the small sample size, this points to a critical component of disease dynamics that has clinical implications and emphasizes a need for a study using a larger cohort. It is also essential to study the potential factors associated with higher risk of exposure to newly diagnosed and HIV positive patients at the community level. In addition, our ability to detect multiple               M. tuberculosis               strains using the standard 24 loci MIRU-VNTR typing especially with allelic diversity in loci 2059 and 3171, which are excluded from the 15-locus MIRU-VNTR, lead us to recommend the use of this genotyping technique, especially in areas with tuberculosis endemicity similar to this study.},

Consequently, the regulation of SM levels at the PM by enzymes such as sphingomyelinase (SMase) and SM synthase 2 (SMS2) can have profound effects - both on biophysical properties of the membrane, but also on cellular signaling. Over the past 20 years, there has been considerable research into the physiological and cellular functions associated with regulation of SM levels, notably with regards to the production of ceramide. In this review, we will summarize this research with particular focus on the SMases and SMS2. We will outline what biological functions are associated with SM metabolism/production at the PM, and discuss what we believe are major challenges that need to be addressed in future studies. © 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

  abstract = {Acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) converts the lipid sphingomyelin (SM) to phosphocholine and ceramide and has optimum activity at acidic pH. Normally, ASMase is located in lysosomes and endosomes, but membrane damage or the interaction with some bacterial and viral pathogens can trigger its recruitment to the plasma membrane. Rhinovirus and measles viruses each require ASMase activity during early stages of infection. Both sphingomyelin and ceramide are important components of lipid rafts and are potent signaling molecules. Each plays roles in mediating macropinocytosis, which has been shown to be important for ebolavirus (EBOV) infection. Here, we investigated the role of ASMase and its substrate, SM, in EBOV infection. The work was performed at biosafety level 4 with wild-type virus with specificity and mechanistic analysis performed using virus pseudotypes and virus-like particles. We found that virus particles strongly associate with the SM-rich regions of the cell membrane and depletion of SM reduces EBOV infection. ASM-specific drugs and multiple small interfering RNAs strongly inhibit the infection by EBOV and EBOV glycoprotein pseudotyped viruses but not by the pseudotypes bearing the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. Interestingly, the binding of virus-like particles to cells is strongly associated with surface-localized ASMase as well as SM-enriched sites. Our work suggests that ASMase activity and SM presence are necessary for efficient infection of cells by EBOV. The inhibition of this pathway may provide new avenues for drug treatment.},

The past 10 years have seen an explosion of interest in imaging cellular processes, down to the molecular level. There are now many advanced techniques being applied to live cell imaging. However, cellular health is often under appreciated. For many researchers, if the cell at the end of the experiment has not gone into apoptosis or is blebbed beyond recognition, than all is well. This is simply incorrect. There are many factors that need to be considered when performing live-cell imaging in order to maintain cellular health such as: imaging modality, media, temperature, humidity, PH, osmolality, and photon dose. The wavelength of illuminating light, and the total photon dose that the cells are exposed to, comprise two of the most important and controllable parameters of live-cell imaging. The lowest photon dose that achieves a measureable metric for the experimental question should be used, not the dose that produces cover photo quality images. This is paramount to ensure that the cellular processes being investigated are in their in vitro state and not shifted to an alternate pathway due to environmental stress. The timing of the mitosis is an ideal canary in the gold mine, in that any stress induced from the imaging will result in the increased length of mitosis, thus providing a control model for the current imagining conditions.},

We performed a comprehensive identification of essential genes in               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               , the major causative agent of tuberculosis, using a combination of transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) and comparative genomic analysis. To identify conditionally essential genes by Tn-seq, we used media with different nutrient compositions. Although many conditional gene essentialities were affected by the presence of relevant nutrient sources, we also found that the essentiality of genes in a subset of metabolic pathways was unaffected by metabolite availability. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that not all essential genes identified by Tn-seq were fully conserved within the               M. tuberculosis               complex, including some existing antitubercular drug target genes. In addition, we utilized an available               M. tuberculosis               genome-scale metabolic model, iSM810, to predict               M. tuberculosis               gene essentiality               in silico               . Comparing the sets of essential genes experimentally identified by Tn-seq to those predicted               in silico               reveals the capabilities and limitations of gene essentiality predictions, highlighting the complexity of               M. tuberculosis               essential metabolic functions.

Thus, our study identifies numerous potential antitubercular drug targets and provides a comprehensive picture of the complexity of               M. tuberculosis               essential cellular functions.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis               causes tuberculosis, which kills more people than any other infection.               M. tuberculosis               grows in macrophages, cells that specialize in engulfing and degrading microorganisms. Like many intracellular pathogens, in order to cause disease,               M. tuberculosis               damages the membrane-bound compartment (phagosome) in which it is enclosed after macrophage uptake. Recent work showed that when chemicals damage this type of intracellular compartment, cells rapidly detect and repair the damage, using machinery called the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Therefore, we hypothesized that ESCRT might also respond to pathogen-induced damage. At the same time, our previous work showed that the EsxG-EsxH heterodimer of               M. tuberculosis               can inhibit ESCRT, raising the possibility that               M. tuberculosis               impairs this host response. Here, we show that ESCRT is recruited to damaged               M. tuberculosis               phagosomes and that EsxG-EsxH undermines ESCRT-mediated endomembrane repair. Thus, our studies demonstrate a battle between host and pathogen over endomembrane integrity.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Intracellular pathogens have varied strategies to breach the endolysosomal barrier so that they can deliver effectors to the host cytosol, access nutrients, replicate in the cytoplasm, and avoid degradation in the lysosome. In the case of               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               , the bacterium perforates the phagosomal membrane shortly after being taken up by macrophages. Phagosomal damage depends upon the mycobacterial ESX-1 type VII secretion system (T7SS). Sterile insults, such as silica crystals or membranolytic peptides, can also disrupt phagosomal and endolysosomal membranes. Recent work revealed that the host endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery rapidly responds to sterile endolysosomal damage and promotes membrane repair. We hypothesized that ESCRTs might also respond to pathogen-induced phagosomal damage and that               M. tuberculosis               could impair this host response. Indeed, we found that ESCRT-III proteins were recruited to               M. tuberculosis               phagosomes in an               ESX-1               -dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that the mycobacterial effectors EsxG/TB9.8 and EsxH/TB10.4, both secreted by the ESX-3 T7SS, can inhibit ESCRT-dependent trafficking of receptors to the lysosome. Here, we additionally show that ESCRT-III recruitment to sites of endolysosomal damage is antagonized by EsxG and EsxH, both within the context of               M. tuberculosis               infection and sterile injury. Moreover, EsxG and EsxH themselves respond within minutes to membrane damage in a manner that is independent of calcium and ESCRT-III recruitment. Thus, our study reveals that T7SS effectors and ESCRT participate in a series of measures and countermeasures for control of phagosome integrity.

However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1-dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model,C1orf106-/-mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments. These findings delineate a mechanism by which a genetic polymorphism fine-tunes intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and elucidate a fundamental mechanism of cellular junctional control.},

  abstract = {Bcr-Abl (break-point cluster region-abelson), the oncogenic trigger of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), has previously been shown to up-regulate the expression and activity of sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), which contributes to the proliferation of CML cells; however, the mechanism by which this increased expression of SMS1 is mediated remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Bcr-Abl enhances the expression of SMS1 via a 30-fold up-regulation of its transcription. Of most interest, the Bcr-Abl-regulated transcription of SMS1 is initiated from a novel transcription start site (TSS) that is just upstream of the open reading frame. This shift in TSS utilization generates an SMS1 mRNA with a substantially shorter 59 UTR compared with its canonical mRNA. This shorter 59 UTR imparts a 20-fold greater translational efficiency to SMS1 mRNA, which further contributes to the increase of its expression in CML cells. Therefore, our study demonstrates that Bcr-Abl increases SMS1 protein levels via 2 concerted mechanisms: up-regulation of transcription and enhanced translation as a result of the shift in TSS utilization. Remarkably, this is the first time that an oncogene-Bcr-Abl-has been demonstrated to drive such a mechanism that up-regulates the expression of a functionally important target gene, SMS1.},

Acquired immunity does not exist in invertebrates despite the fact that they also face increased risks of reinfection following primary exposure. However, when subjected to immune insult, insects can produce immune responses that persist for long enough to provide prophylaxis. Because these immune responses are costly, persistence must be maintained through a selective advantage. We tested for the possibility that these long-lasting immune responses provided increased resistance to later infections by experimentally mimicking a primary immune insult (pre-challenge) in larvae of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prior to early or late exposure to spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. We found that pre-challenged larvae produced a long-lasting antimicrobial response, which provided a survival benefit when the larvae were exposed to fungal infection. These results suggest that the observed response is functionally 'adaptive'.},

Chemical sequencing from its amino terminus and of peptides obtained by digestion with protease from Staphylococcus aureus strain V-8 demonstrated that saposin A is derived from proteolytic processing of domain 1 of its precursor protein, prosaposin. Processing of prosaposin (70 kDa) also generates three other previously reported saposin proteins, B, C, and D, from its second, third, and fourth domains. Similar to saposin C, saposin A stimulates the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-glucoside and glucocerebroside by beta-glucosylceramidase and of galactocerebroside by beta-galactosylceramidase, mainly by increasing the maximal velocity of both reactions. Saposin A is as active as saposin C in these reactions. Saposin A has no significant effect on other sphingolipid and 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside hydrolases tested. Saposin A has two potential glycosylation sites that appear to be glycosylated. After deglycosylation, saposin A had a subunit molecular mass of 10 kDa and was as active as native saposin A. However, reduction and alkylation abolished the activation. A three-dimensional model comparing saposins A and C reveals significant sequence homology between them, especially preservation of conserved acidic and basic residues in their middle regions. Each appears to possess a conformationally rigid hydrophobic pocket stabilized by three internal disulfide bridges, with amphipathic helical regions interrupted by helix breakers.},

This study reveals that α-oxidation of 2-hydroxy fatty acids involving 2-hydroxy acyl-CoA lyase HACL2 is the major pathway for odd-chain fatty acid production, at least in the brain and stomach.           ,              Although most fatty acids (FAs) are even chain, certain tissues, including brain, contain relatively large quantities of odd-chain FAs in their sphingolipids. One of the pathways producing odd-chain FAs is the α-oxidation of 2-hydroxy (2-OH) FAs, where 2-OH acyl-CoA lyases (HACL1 and HACL2) catalyze the key cleavage reaction. However, the contribution of each HACL to odd-chain FA production in vivo remains unknown. Here, we found that HACL2 and HACL1 play major roles in the α-oxidation of 2-OH FAs (especially very-long-chain types) and 3-methyl FAs (other α-oxidation substrates), respectively, using ectopic expression systems of human HACL2 and HACL1 in yeast and analyzing Hacl1 and/or Hacl2 knockout (KO) CHO-K1 cells. We then generated Hacl2 KO mice and measured the quantities of odd-chain and 2-OH lipids (free FAs and sphingolipids [ceramides, sphingomyelins, and monohexosylceramides]) in 17 tissues. We observed fewer odd-chain lipids and more 2-OH lipids in many tissues of Hacl2 KO mice than in wild-type mice, and of these differences the reductions were most prominent for odd-chain monohexosylceramides in the brain and ceramides in the stomach. These results indicate that HACL2-involved α-oxidation of 2-OH FAs is mainly responsible for odd-chain FA production in the brain and stomach.},

In this study, a novel fluorometric method was developed for measuring PG and CL using combinations of specific enzymes and Amplex Red. This assay quantified the sum of PG and CL (PG\,+\,CL) regardless of the species of fatty acyl chain. The calibration curve for PG\,+\,CL measurement was linear and the detection limit was 1\,μM (10\,pmol in the reaction mixture). This new method was applied to the determinations of PG\,+\,CL content in HEK293 cells and CL content in purified mitochondria, because the mitochondrial content of PG is negligible compared with that of CL. We demonstrated that the PG+CL content was greater at low cell density than at high cell density. The overexpression of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase 1 (PGS1) increased the cellular contents of PG\,+\,CL and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and reduced that of phosphatidic acid. PGS1 overexpression also elevated the mitochondrial contents of CL and PC, but had no effect on the number of mitochondria per cell. In addition to the enzymatic measurements of other phospholipids, this simple, sensitive and high-throughput assay for measuring PG\,+\,CL can be used to understand cellular, physiological and pathological processes.},

HYL-1 function is required for synthesis of ceramides and sphingolipids containing very long acyl-chains (≥C24), while HYL-2 is required for synthesis of ceramides and sphingolipids containing shorter acyl-chains (≤C22). Here we show that functional loss of HYL-2 decreases lifespan, while loss of HYL-1 or LAGR-1 does not affect lifespan. We show that loss of HYL-1 and LAGR-1 functions extend lifespan in an autophagy-dependent manner, as knock down of the autophagy-associated gene ATG-12 abolishes hyl-1;lagr-1 longevity. The transcription factors PHA-4/FOXA, DAF-16/FOXO, and SKN-1 are also required for the observed lifespan extension, as well as the increased number of autophagosomes in hyl-1;lagr-1 animals. Both autophagic events and the transcription factors PHA-4/FOXA, DAF-16, and SKN-1 have previously been associated with dietary restriction-induced longevity. Accordingly, we find that hyl-1;lagr-1 animals display reduced feeding, increased resistance to heat, and reduced reproduction. Collectively, our data suggest that specific sphingolipids produced by different ceramide synthases have opposing roles in determination of C. elegans lifespan. We propose that loss of HYL-1 and LAGR-1 result in dietary restriction-induced autophagy and consequently prolonged longevity. © 2013 Mosbech et al.},

  abstract = {HIV-1 assembles at the plasma membrane (PM) of infected cells. PM association of the main structural protein Gag depends on its myristoylated MA domain and PM PI(4,5)P2. Using a novel chemical biology tool that allows rapidly tunable manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 levels in living cells, we show that depletion of PI(4,5)P2 completely prevents Gag PM targeting and assembly site formation. Unexpectedly, PI(4,5)P2 depletion also caused loss of pre-assembled Gag lattices from the PM. Subsequent restoration of PM PI(4,5)P2 reinduced assembly site formation even in the absence of new protein synthesis, indicating that the dissociated Gag molecules remained assembly competent. These results reveal an important role of PI(4,5)P2 for HIV-1 morphogenesis beyond Gag recruitment to the PM and suggest a dynamic equilibrium of Gag-lipid interactions. Furthermore, they establish an experimental system that permits synchronized induction of HIV-1 assembly leading to induced production of infectious virions by targeted modulation of Gag PM targeting.Viruses are parasites that must infect the living cell of a host in order to grow and replicate. To do so, the virus attaches to the host’s cell and transfers its genetic material to the inside. The virus then hijacks the cell and forces it to build proteins and more genetic material that will assemble into new copies of the virus, and the completed virus particles are released to infect new cells.The HIV-1 virus encodes a protein called Gag that coordinates the assembly of new copies of this virus. Thousands of Gag proteins accumulate into a lattice at the inside of the host cell membrane by an unknown mechanism, where they gather all essential components to form a new infectious virus. Once completed, the virus particle detaches itself from the host cell and Gag gives the virus its structure.Previous research by several groups has shown that a lipid molecule found in cell membranes called PIP2 can bind to Gag and helps the virus to assemble. However, until now, it was unclear if PIP2 anchors Gag to the cell membrane of living cells and if it plays any other roles in the later stages of assembly.Now, Mücksch et al. have developed a new approach to study this question by rapidly manipulating the levels of PIP2 in living cells and monitoring Gag assembly through a fluorescent marker. The experiments showed that PIP2 was needed to initiate the assembly process, but also to maintain the partially assembled Gag lattice at the membrane. When PIP2 was removed, Gag proteins could not gather at the cell membrane and the already assembled Gag lattices broke down. When PIP2 levels were increased again, the Gag proteins that had disappeared from the membrane formed new lattices. This suggests that PIP2 has a much broader role in HIV-1 particle formation than previously assumed.A next step will be to use this new experimental approach to study how particles of HIV are assembled and released. This knowledge may help scientists to develop antiviral drugs that interfere with the assembly step of the virus that could be used to prevent or treat HIV infections.},

A membrane‐permeant caged PI derivative featuring a photo‐removable coumarinyl group masking the negative charge of the phosphate, as well as two enzymatically removable butyrate esters for increased lipophilicity and for preventing phosphate migration, were synthesized. Rapid cell entry and cellular labeling in fixed cells was demonstrated by a photo‐cross‐linkable diazirine followed by attachment of a fluorophore through click chemistry. Using this technique, we found that the multifunctional caged PI derivative resided predominantly at internal membranes but rapidly changed to the plasma membrane after uncaging. Accordingly, a preliminary proteomic analysis of the lipid–protein conjugates revealed that the two major PI transport proteins PITPα and β were prime targets of the photo‐cross‐linked PI derivative.},

  abstract = {Pore-forming toxins form a family of proteins that act as virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, but similar proteins are found in all kingdoms of life, including the vertebrate immune system. They are secreted as soluble monomers that oligomerize on target membranes in the so-called prepore state; after activation, they insert into the membrane and adopt the pore state. Lysenin is a pore-forming toxin from the earthworm Eisenida foetida, of which both the soluble and membrane-inserted structures are solved. However, the activation and membrane-insertion mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to directly visualize the membrane-insertion mechanism. Changing the environmental pH from pH 7.5 to below pH 6.0 favored membrane insertion. We detected a short α-helix in the soluble structure that comprised three glutamic acids (Glu92, Glu94, and Glu97) that we hypothesized may represent a pH-sensor (as in similar toxins, e.g., Listeriolysin). Mutant lysenin still can form pores, but mutating these glutamic acids to glutamines rendered the toxin pH-insensitive. On the other hand, toxins in the pore state did not favor insertion of neighboring prepores; indeed, pore insertion breaks the hexagonal ordered domains of prepores and separates from neighboring molecules in the membrane. pH-dependent activation of toxins may represent a common feature of pore-forming toxins. High-speed atomic force microscopy with single-molecule resolution at high temporal resolution and the possibility of exchanging buffers during the experiments presents itself as a unique tool for the study of toxin-state conversion.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS To analyze the role of lipid rafts in the endocytic uptake of microspheres by macrophages, we studied the incorporation of polystyrene latex microspheres (PSL MS) by treating macrophages with reagents that affect the physicochemical and biochemical functions of their lipid rafts, such as the cholesterol depletor methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and the inhibitor of scavenger receptors polyinosinic acid (poly I). For this study, we used 3-μm fluorescent polystyrene latex microspheres (F-PSL MS) and J774 murine macrophage. RESULTS We found that the endocytosis of J774 cells was remarkably reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by treatment of the cells with MβCD and that endocytosis was suppressed by approximately 50\% by treatment with 100 μg/ml poly I. These results suggest that scavenger receptors are associated with phagocytosis of F-PSL MS and that their functions are regulated by lipid rafts. CONCLUSION PSL MS are phagocytosed via a raft-dependent pathway.},

Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Canadian Thoracic Society, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, and the World Health Organization also participated in the development of the guideline. This guideline provides recommendations on the clinical and public health management of tuberculosis in children and adults in settings in which mycobacterial cultures, molecular and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests, and radiographic studies, among other diagnostic tools, are available on a routine basis. For all recommendations, literature reviews were performed, followed by discussion by an expert committee according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Given the public health implications of prompt diagnosis and effective management of tuberculosis, empiric multidrug treatment is initiated in almost all situations in which active tuberculosis is suspected. Additional characteristics such as presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, and response to treatment influence management decisions. Specific recommendations on the use of case management strategies (including directly observed therapy), regimen and dosing selection in adults and children (daily vs intermittent), treatment of tuberculosis in the presence of HIV infection (duration of tuberculosis treatment and timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy), as well as treatment of extrapulmonary disease (central nervous system, pericardial among other sites) are provided. The development of more potent and better-tolerated drug regimens, optimization of drug exposure for the component drugs, optimal management of tuberculosis in special populations, identification of accurate biomarkers of treatment effect, and the assessment of new strategies for implementing regimens in the field remain key priority areas for research. See the full-text online version of the document for detailed discussion of the management of tuberculosis and recommendations for practice.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol is a major structural component of the plasma membrane (PM). The majority of PM cholesterol forms complexes with other PM lipids, making it inaccessible for intracellular transport. Transition of PM cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible pools maintains cellular homeostasis, but how cells monitor PM cholesterol accessibility remains unclear. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored lipid transfer proteins, the GRAMD1s, sense and transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. GRAMD1s bind one another and populate at ER-PM contacts by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol via GRAM domains and facilitate its transport via StART-like domains. Cells lacking all three GRAMD1s exhibit striking expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol due to less efficient PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol. Thus, GRAMD1s facilitate movement of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER in order to counteract acute increase of PM cholesterol, activating non-vesicular cholesterol transport.},

While polymerase chain reaction is the front-line tool for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, application of amplification-free and culture-free methods for isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, partnered with next-generation sequencing, would provide a useful tool for both surveillance and research of SARS-CoV-2. We here release into the public domain a set of bait capture hybridization probe sequences for enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from complex biological samples. These probe sequences have been designed using rigorous bioinformatics methods to provide sensitivity, accuracy, and minimal off-target hybridization. Probe design was based on existing, validated approaches for detecting antimicrobial resistance genes in complex samples and it is our hope that this SARS-CoV-2 bait capture platform, once validated by those with samples in hand, will be of aid in combating the current outbreak.},

Here, we identified additional Mtb mutants that have a reduced ability to import a fluorescent fatty acid substrate during infection within macrophages. This screen identified the novel genes as rv2799 and rv0966c as be necessary for fatty acid import and confirmed the central role for Rv3723/LucA and putative components of the Mce1 fatty acid transporter (Rv0200/OmamB, Rv0172/Mce1D, and Rv0655/MceG) in this process.},

  abstract = {Members of the Flaviviridae virus family comprise a large group of enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome of positive polarity. Several genera belong to this family, including the Hepacivirus genus, of which hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the prototype member, and the Flavivirus genus, which contains both dengue virus and Zika virus. Viruses of these genera differ in many respects, such as the mode of transmission or the course of infection, which is either predominantly persistent in the case of HCV or acutely self-limiting in the case of flaviviruses. Although the fundamental replication strategy of Flaviviridae members is similar, during the past few years, important differences have been discovered, including the way in which these viruses exploit cellular resources to facilitate viral propagation. These differences might be responsible, at least in part, for the various biological properties of these viruses, thus offering the possibility to learn from comparisons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how Flaviviridae viruses manipulate and usurp cellular pathways in infected cells. Specifically, we focus on comparing strategies employed by flaviviruses with those employed by hepaciviruses, and we discuss the importance of these interactions in the context of viral replication and antiviral therapies.},

The infection on Vero E6 - a permissive cell line to SARS-CoV - could be neutralized by sera from convalescent SARS patients, and the entry was a pH-dependent process. With these highly infectious SARS-CoV pseudotypes, several cell lines derived from various tissues were revealed as susceptible to SARS-CoV, which were highly corresponding to the expression pattern of virus's receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Here we report that cells exploit a sphingomyelin-based lysosomal repair pathway that operates independently of ESCRT to reverse potentially lethal membrane damage. Various conditions perturbing organelle integrity trigger a rapid calcium-activated scrambling and cytosolic exposure of sphingomyelin. Subsequent metabolic conversion of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinases on the cytosolic surface of injured lysosomes promotes their repair, also when ESCRT function is compromised. Conversely, blocking turnover of cytosolic sphingomyelin renders cells more sensitive to lysosome-damaging drugs. Our data indicate that calcium-activated scramblases, sphingomyelin, and neutral sphingomyelinases are core components of a previously unrecognized membrane restoration pathway by which cells preserve the functional integrity of lysosomes.},

Its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Here, we studied whether NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 promotes breast cancer metastasis through reprogramming cholesterol metabolism.                                         Methods               ELISA was employed to measure the concentration of Nesfatin-1 in the serum of breast cancer patients and the control group. Database analysis suggested that NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 might be acetylated in breast cancer, which was confirmed by treating the breast cancer cells with acetyltransferase inhibitors. Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays were conducted, and nude mouse lung metastasis models were established to examine the effect of NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 on breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The Affymetrix gene expression chip results were analyzed using IPA software to identify the critical pathway induced by NUCB2/Nesfatin-1. We evaluated the effect of NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 on cholesterol biosynthesis through the mTORC1-SREBP2-HMGCR axis by utilizing mTORC1 inhibitor and rescue experiments.                                         Results               NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 was found to be overexpressed in the breast cancer patients, and its overexpression was positively correlated with poor prognosis. NUCB2 was potentially acetylated, leading to high expression in breast cancer. NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 promoted metastasis in vitro and in vivo, while Nesfatin-1 rescued impaired cell metastasis induced by NUCB2 depletion. Mechanistically, NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 upregulated cholesterol synthesis via the mTORC1 signal pathway, contributing to breast cancer migration and metastasis.                                         Conclusions               Our findings demonstrate that the NUCB2/Nesfatin-1/mTORC1/SREBP2 signal pathway is critical in regulating cholesterol synthesis, essential for breast cancer metastasis. Thus, NUCB2/Nesfatin-1 might be utilized as a diagnostic tool and also used in cancer therapy for breast cancer in the future.},

Here, we describe a set of lipid-based chemical proteomic probes and their global interaction map in mammalian cells. These interactions involve hundreds of proteins from diverse functional classes and frequently occur at sites of drug action. We determine the target profiles for several drugs across the lipid-interaction proteome, revealing that its ligandable content extends far beyond traditionally defined categories of druggable proteins. In further support of this finding, we describe a selective ligand for the lipid-binding protein nucleobindin-1 (NUCB1) and show that this compound perturbs the hydrolytic and oxidative metabolism of endocannabinoids in cells. The described chemical proteomic platform thus provides an integrated path to both discover and pharmacologically characterize a wide range of proteins that participate in lipid pathways in cells.},

There is only one Ugcg gene in the mouse genome, which is essential in embryogenesis and brain development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has three Ugcg genes (cgt-1, cgt-2 and cgt-3), and double RNAi of the cgt-1 and cgt-3 genes results in lethality at the L1 larval stage. In this study, we isolated knockout worms for the three genes and characterized the gene functions. Each gene product showed active enzymatic activity when expressed in GM95 cells deficient in glycosphingolipids (GSLs). When each gene function was disrupted, the brood size of the animal markedly decreased, and abnormal oocytes and multinucleated embryos were formed. The CGT-3 protein had the highest Ugcg activity, and knockout of its gene resulted in the severest phenotype. When cgt-3 RNAi was performed on rrf-1 worms lacking somatic RNAi machinery but with intact germline RNAi machinery, a number of abnormal oocytes and multinucleated eggs were observed, although the somatic phenotype, i.e., L1 lethal effects of cgt-1/cgt-3 RNAi, was completely suppressed. Cell surface expression of GSLs and sphingomyelin, which are important components of membrane domains, was affected in the RNAi-treated embryos. In the embryos, an abnormality in cytokinesis was also observed.

  abstract = {Summary Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.},

  abstract = {Reports suggest that excessive ceramide accumulation in mitochondria is required to initiate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and subsequent cell death, but how ceramide accumulates is unclear. Here we report that liver mitochondria exhibit ceramide formation from sphingosine and palmitoyl-CoA and from sphingosine and palmitate. Importantly, this activity was markedly decreased in liver from neutral ceramidase (NCDase)-deficient mice. Moreover, the levels of ceramide were dissimilar in liver mitochondria of WT and NCDase KO mice. These results suggest that NCDase is a key participant of ceramide formation in liver mitochondria. We also report that highly purified liver mitochondria have ceramidase, reverse ceramidase, and thioesterase activities. Increased accessibility of palmitoyl-CoA to the mitochondrial matrix with the pore-forming peptide zervamicin IIB resulted in 2-fold increases in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis by thioesterase. This increased hydrolysis was accompanied by an increase in ceramide formation, demonstrating that both outer membrane and matrix localized thioesterases can regulate ceramide formation. Also, ceramide formation might occur both in the outer mitochondrial membrane and in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting the existence of distinct ceramide pools. Taken together, these results suggest that the reverse activity of NCDase contributes to sphingolipid homeostasis in this organelle in vivo.},

To comprehensively identify IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, we assembled a CRISPR sgRNA library of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) into a modified lentiviral vector that allows for packaging of sgRNA-encoding genomes in trans into budding HIV-1 particles. We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. A small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5alpha together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strain, HIV-1LAI, in THP-1 cells. A second screen with a CCR5-tropic primary strain, HIV-1Q23.BG505, described an overlapping, but non-identical, panel of restriction factors. Further, this screen also identifies HIV dependency factors. The ability of IFN-induced restriction factors to inhibit HIV strains to replicate in human cells suggests that these human restriction factors are incompletely antagonized.},

Prior contained latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis can provide up to~80 percent protection against disease with subsequent exposure.~In patients with previous active disease, there is an increased risk of recurrence of active tuberculosis due to distinct strains in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected patients.~Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been associated with a reduction in childhood mortality which is~not attributable to tuberculosis.~ Reduction in childhood mortality may be due to epigenetic reprogramming of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD2) receptor. ~ BCG vaccine can be~given either intracutaneously or intradermally.

We mathematically analyze the GOE in terms of ecological dynamics coupled with a changing Earth. Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria initially dominate over cyanobacteria, but their success depends on the availability of suitable electron donors that are vulnerable to oxidation. The GOE is triggered when the difference between the influxes of relevant reductants and phosphate falls below a critical value that is an increasing function of the reproductive rate of cyanobacteria. The transition can be either gradual and reversible or sudden and irreversible, depending on sources and sinks of oxygen. Increasing sources and decreasing sinks of oxygen can also trigger the GOE, but this possibility depends strongly on migration of cyanobacteria from privileged sites. Our model links ecological dynamics to planetary change, with geophysical evolution determining the relevant time scales.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Tuberculosis (TB), an ancient disease of humanity, continues to be a major cause of worldwide death. The causative agent of TB,               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               , and its close pathogenic relative               Mycobacterium marinum               , initially infect, evade, and exploit macrophages, a major host defense against invading pathogens. Within macrophages, mycobacteria reside within host membrane–bound compartments called phagosomes. Mycobacterium-induced damage of the phagosomal membranes is integral to pathogenesis, and this activity has been attributed to the specialized mycobacterial secretion system ESX-1, and particularly to ESAT-6, its major secreted protein. Here, we show that the integrity of the unstructured ESAT-6 C terminus is required for macrophage phagosomal damage, granuloma formation, and virulence.                        ,                             Mycobacterium tuberculosis               and its close relative               Mycobacterium marinum               infect macrophages and induce the formation of granulomas, organized macrophage-rich immune aggregates. These mycobacterial pathogens can accelerate and co-opt granuloma formation for their benefit, using the specialized secretion system ESX-1, a key virulence determinant. ESX-1–mediated virulence is attributed to the damage it causes to the membranes of macrophage phagosomal compartments, within which the bacteria reside. This phagosomal damage, in turn, has been attributed to the membranolytic activity of ESAT-6, the major secreted substrate of ESX-1. However, mutations that perturb ESAT-6’s membranolytic activity often result in global impairment of ESX-1 secretion. This has precluded an understanding of the causal and mechanistic relationships between ESAT-6 membranolysis and ESX-1–mediated virulence. Here, we identify two conserved residues in the unstructured C-terminal tail of ESAT-6 required for phagosomal damage, granuloma formation, and virulence. Importantly, these ESAT-6 mutants have near-normal levels of secretion, far higher than the minimal threshold we establish is needed for ESX-1–mediated virulence early in infection. Unexpectedly, these loss-of-function ESAT-6 mutants retain the ability to lyse acidified liposomes. Thus, ESAT-6’s virulence functions in~vivo can be uncoupled from this in~vitro surrogate assay. These uncoupling mutants highlight an enigmatic functional domain of ESAT-6 and provide key tools to investigate the mechanism of phagosomal damage and virulence.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Mycobacterium tuberculosis               is associated with the activation of cytokine circuits both at sites of active tuberculosis in vivo and in cultures of mononuclear cells stimulated by               M. tuberculosis               or its components in vitro. Interactive stimulatory and/or inhibitory pathways are established between cytokines, which may result in potentiation or attenuation of the effects of each molecule on T-cell responses. Here we examined the interaction of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated human mononuclear cell cultures in vitro. TGF-β1 induced monocyte IL-10 (but not tumor necrosis factor alpha) production (by 70-fold,               P               {$<$} 0.02) and mRNA expression in the absence but not in the presence of PPD. Both exogenous recombinant (r) IL-10 and rTGF-β1 independently suppressed the production of PPD-induced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in mononuclear cells from PPD skin test-positive individuals. Synergistic suppression of IFN-γ in cultures containing both rTGF-β1 and rIL-10 was only seen when the responder cell population were peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and not monocyte-depleted mononuclear cells and when PBMC were pretreated with rTGF-β1 but not with rIL-10. Suppression of PPD-induced IFN-γ in PBMC containing both rTGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) and rIL-10 (100 pg/ml) was 1.5-fold higher (               P               {$<$} 0.05) than cultures containing TGF-β1 alone and 5.7-fold higher (               P               {$<$} 0.004) than cultures containing IL-10 alone. Also, neutralization of endogenous TGF-β1 and IL-10 together enhanced PPD-induced IFN-γ in PBMC in a synergistic manner. Thus, TGF-β1 and IL-10 together potentiate the downmodulatory effect on               M. tuberculosis               -induced T-cell production of IFN-γ, and TGF-β1 alone enhances IL-10 production. At sites of active               M. tuberculosis               infection, these interactions may be conducive to the suppression of mononuclear cell functions.},

  abstract = {Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) has two critical virulence factors—a type III secretion system (T3SS) and Shiga toxins (Stxs)—that are required for the pathogen to colonize the intestine and cause diarrheal disease. Here, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9) loss-of-function screen to identify host loci that facilitate EHEC infection of intestinal epithelial cells. Many of the guide RNAs identified targeted loci known to be associated with sphingolipid biosynthesis, particularly for production of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the Stx receptor. Two loci (TM9SF2 and LAPTM4A) with largely unknown functions were also targeted. Mutations in these loci not only rescued cells from Stx-mediated cell death, but also prevented cytotoxicity associated with the EHEC T3SS. These mutations interfered with early events associated with T3SS and Stx pathogenicity, markedly reducing entry of T3SS effectors into host cells and binding of Stx. The convergence of Stx and T3SS onto overlapping host targets provides guidance for design of new host-directed therapeutic agents to counter EHEC infection.},

We found that spent media from the CoNS species Staphylococcus caprae can inhibit agr-mediated quorum sensing by all classes of S. aureus. A biochemical assessment of the inhibitory activity suggested that the S. caprae autoinducing peptide (AIP) was responsible, and mass spectrometric analysis identified the S. caprae AIP as an eight-residue peptide (YSTCSYYF). Using a murine model of intradermal MRSA infection, the therapeutic efficacy of synthetic S. caprae AIP was evident by a dramatic reduction in both dermonecrotic injury and cutaneous bacterial burden relative to controls. Competition experiments between S. caprae and MRSA demonstrated a significant reduction in MRSA burden using murine models of both skin colonization and intradermal infection. Our findings indicate that important interactions occur between commensals that can impact disease outcomes and potentially shape the composition of the natural flora. Paharik, Parlet, et al. demonstrate that the human commensal Staphylococcus caprae competes with Staphylococcus aureus by inhibiting quorum sensing. Through signal interference, S. caprae reduces methicillin-resistant S. aureus burden in both skin colonization and infection, highlighting the benefits of healthy skin flora and suggesting a new avenue for probiotic therapy.},

  abstract = {Notch signaling is a well-conserved pathway involved in cell fate decisions, proliferation and apoptosis. We report on the involvement of Notch signaling in regulating gene expression in activated macrophages. Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists such as bacterial lipopeptide, polyl:C, lipopolysaccharide and unmethylated CpG DNA all induced up-regulation of Notch1 in primary and macrophage-like cell lines. Notchl up-regulation was dependent on the MyD88 pathway when stimulated through TLR2, but not TLR4. Activated Notch1 and expression of the Notch target genes, Hes1 and Deltex, were detected in activated macrophages, suggesting that Notch signaling was activated upon stimulation. Inhibiting processing of Notch receptor by γ-secretase using a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), the expression of Notch1 was down-regulated to basal levels. This treatment significantly modulated expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. In addition, the amount of nitric oxide produced was significantly lower and the expression of MHC class II was up-regulated in GSI-treated cells. Treatment with GSI or silencing Notch1 resulted in decreased translocation of NF-κBp50 into nucleus upon stimulation. Taken together, stimulation of macrophages through the TLR signaling cascade triggered activation of Notch signaling, which in turn regulated gene expression patterns involved in pro-inflammatory responses, through activation of NF-κB. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

  abstract = {A hallmark of tuberculosis is the ability of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to persist for decades despite a vigorous host immune response. Previously, we identified a myco-bacterial gene cluster, mce4, that was specifically required for bacterial survival during this prolonged infection. We now show that mce4 encodes a cholesterol import system that enables M. tuberculosis to derive both carbon and energy from this ubiquitous component of host membranes. Cholesterol import is not required for establishing infection in mice or for growth in resting macro-phages. However, this function is essential for persistence in the lungs of chronically infected animals and for growth within the IFN-activated macrophages that predominate at this stage of infection. This finding indicates that a major effect of IFN-stimulation may be to sequester potential pathogens in a compartment devoid of more commonly used nutrients. The unusual capacity to catabolize sterols allows M. tuberculosis to circumvent this defense and thereby sustain a persistent infection. bacterial pathogenesis mce metabolism tuberculosis carbon},

Phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols are important constituents of biological membranes. Many lipids play important roles in the regulation of cell metabolism by acting as signaling molecules. Neutral lipids, including TAGs and sterol esters (STEs), are important storage lipids in cells. In view of the importance of lipid molecules, this review briefly summarizes the metabolic pathways for sterols, phospholipids, sphingolipids, fatty acids, and neutral lipids in fungi and illustrates the differences between fungal and human (or other mammalian) cells, especially in relation to lipid biosynthetic pathways. These differences might provide valuable clues for us to find target proteins for novel antifungal drugs. In addition, the development of lipidomics technology in recent years has supplied us with a shortcut for finding new antifungal drug targets; this ability is important for guiding our research on pathogenic fungi.},

  abstract = {3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) is the key enzyme in the de novo sphingolipid synthesis. We identified a novel missense kdsrI105R mutation in zebrafish that led to a loss of function, and resulted in progression of hepatomegaly to steatosis, then hepatic injury phenotype. Lipidomics analysis of the kdsrI105R mutant revealed compensatory activation of the sphingolipid salvage pathway, resulting in significant accumulation of sphingolipids including ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Ultrastructural analysis revealed swollen mitochondria with cristae damage in the kdsrI105R mutant hepatocytes, which can be a cause of hepatic injury in the mutant. We found elevated sphingosine kinase 2 (sphk2) expression in the kdsrI105R mutant. Genetic interaction analysis with the kdsrI105R and the sphk2wc1 mutants showed that sphk2 depletion suppressed liver defects observed in the kdsrI105R mutant, suggesting that liver defects were mediated by S1P accumulation. Further, both oxidative stress and ER stress were completely suppressed by deletion of sphk2 in kdsrI105R mutants, linking these two processes mechanistically to hepatic injury in the kdsrI105R mutants. Importantly, we found that the heterozygous mutation in kdsr induced predisposed liver injury in adult zebrafish. These data point to kdsr as a novel genetic risk factor for hepatic injury.},

However, this concentration might be high enough to upreg-ulate the expressions of some genes in differentiated macro-phages, which could overwhelm gene expression increases induced by other stimuli. The present study was performed to optimize the PMA concentration required to differentiate monocytes whilst minimizing gene upregulation. Methods: THP-1 cells were treated with 2.5–100 ng/ml PMA and analyzed for the extent of cell adherence, the surface marker of macrophages, and stable differentiation without undesirable gene upregulation. The stably differentiated THP-1 cells at the minimum PMA concentration were treat-ed with 10 ng/ml LPS or 125 nM amyloid beta (Ab 1-42). Results: The treatment of THP-1 with 5 ng/ml PMA was found to be suffi cient to induce stable differentiation without undesirable gene upregulation. These macrophages differen-tiated at 5 ng/ml responded well to secondary weak stimuli like 10 ng/ml LPS or 125 nM of amyloid beta (Ab 1-42). Conclusions: This fi nding suggests that THP-1 cells are well differentiated by 5 ng/ml PMA, and that the resulting differentiated macrophages respond well to secondary weak stimuli without being overwhelmed by undesirable gene up-regulation induced by PMA.},

The rate of growth of each of the isolates in macrophages reflected their known virulence, but the most virulent isolates strongly induced production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α. A key difference, however, was the degree of cell cytotoxicity observed with the more virulent strains ater several days in culture. Staining of cell monolayers for DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis showed that this was minimal and only evident to any degree in macrophages infected with the most virulent strains. In contrast, electron microscopy revealed damage of macrophages consistent with cell necrosis. These results suggest that rapid intracellular growth rate and induction of necrotic cell death within host macrophages are virulence factors of M. tuberculosis in the early stages of bacterial infection. They further imply that infected cell apoptosis, regarded as a defense mechanism or cross-priming mechanism, plays a minimal role.},

  abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically well-studied model nematode or "worm"; however, its N-glycomic complexity is actually baffling and still not completely unraveled. Some features of its N-glycans are, to date, unique and include bisecting galactose and up to five fucose residues associated with the asparagine-linked Man 2-3 GlcNAc 2 core; the substitutions include galactosylation of fucose, fucosylation of galactose and methylation of mannose or fucose residues as well as phosphorylcholine on antennal (non-reducing) N-acetylglucosamine. Only some of these modifications are shared with various other nematodes, while others have yet to be detected in any other species. Thus, C. elegans can be used as a model for some aspects of N-glycan function, but its glycome is far from identical to those of other organisms and is actually far from simple. Possibly the challenges of its native environment, which differ from those of parasitic or necromenic species, led to an anatomically simple worm possessing a complex glycome.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved biological process where pathogens or cellular debris are cleared by engulfing them in a membrane-enclosed cellular compartment called the phagosome. The formation, maturation, and subsequent degradation of a phagosome is an important immune response essential for protection against many pathogens. Yet, the global lipid profile of phagosomes remains unknown, especially as a function of their maturation in immune cells. Here, we show using mass spectrometry based quantitative lipidomics that the ceramide class of lipids, especially very long chain ceramides, are enriched on maturing phagosomes with a concomitant decrease in the biosynthetic precursors of ceramides. We thus posit a new function for the enzyme ceramide synthase during phagocytosis in mammalian macrophages. Biochemical assays, cellular lipid feeding experiments, and pharmacological blockade of ceramide synthase together show that this enzyme indeed controls the flux of ceramides on maturing phagosomes. We also find similar results in the primitive eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, suggesting that ceramide enrichment may be evolutionarily conserved and likely an indispensible step in phagosome maturation.},

Phagosomes undergo fusion and fission events with endosomal and lysosomal compartments, a process called ‘phagosome maturation’, which leads to the degradation of the phagosomal content. However, many phagocytic cells also act as antigen-presenting cells and must balance degradation and peptide preservation. Emerging evidence indicates that receptor engagement by phagosomal cargo, as well as inflammatory mediators and cellular activation affect many aspects of phagosome maturation. Unsurprisingly, pathogens have developed strategies to hijack this machinery, thereby interfering with host immunity. Here, we highlight progress in this field, summarize findings on the impact of immune signals, and discuss consequences for pathogen elimination.},

  abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional phagocytes that use innate sensing and phagocytosis to internalize and degrade self as well as foreign material, such as pathogenic bacteria, within phagosomes. These intracellular compartments are equipped to generate antigenic peptides that serve as source for antigen presentation to T cells initiating adaptive immune responses. The phagosomal proteome of DCs is only partially studied, in particular in response to inflammatory cues, and is highly dynamic as it changes during phagosome maturation, when phagosomes sequentially interact with endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, the activation status of the phagocyte can modulate the phagosomal composition and is able to shape phagosomal functions.In this study, we determined spatiotemporal changes of the proteome of DC phagosomes during their maturation and compared resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived DCs by label-free, quantitative mass spectrometry. Ovalbumin-coupled latex beads were used as phagocytosis model system and revealed that LPS-treated DCs show decreased recruitment of proteins involved in phagosome maturation, such as subunits of the vacuolar proton ATPase, cathepsin B, D, S and RAB7. In contrast, those phagosomes were characterized by an increased recruitment of proteins involved in antigen cross-presentation, e.g. different subunits of MHC I molecules, the proteasome and tapasin, confirming the observed increase in cross-presentation efficacy in those cells. Furthermore, several proteins were identified that were not previously associated with phagosomal functions. Hierarchical clustering of phagosomal proteins demonstrated that their acquisition to DC phagosomes is not only dependent on the duration of phagosome maturation but also on the activation state of DCs. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive overview of how DCs alter their phagosome composition in response to LPS, which has profound impact on the initiation of efficient immune responses.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms leading to osteoporosis are incompletely understood. Genetic disorders with skeletal fragility provide insight into metabolic pathways contributing to bone strength. We evaluated six families with rare skeletal phenotypes and osteoporosis by next-generation sequencing. In all families we identified a heterozygous variant in SGMS2, a gene prominently expressed in cortical bone and encoding the plasma membrane-resident sphingomyelin synthase SMS2. Four unrelated families shared the same nonsense variant c.148C{$>$}T (p.Arg50*) whereas the other families had a missense variant c.185T{$>$}G (p.Ile62Ser) or c.191T{$>$}G (p.Met64Arg). Subjects with p.Arg50* presented with childhood-onset osteoporosis with or without cranial sclerosis. Patients with p.Ile62Ser or p.Met64Arg had a more severe presentation with neonatal fractures, severe short stature, and spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Several subjects had experienced peripheral facial nerve palsy or other neurological manifestations. Bone biopsies showed significantly altered bone material characteristics including defective bone mineralization. Osteoclast formation and function in vitro was normal. While the p.Arg50* mutation yielded a catalytically inactive enzyme, p.Ile62Ser and p.Met64Arg each enhanced the rate of de novo sphingomyelin production by blocking export of a functional enzyme from the endoplasmic reticulum. SGMS2 pathogenic variants underlie a spectrum of skeletal conditions ranging from isolated osteoporosis to complex skeletal dysplasia, suggesting a critical role for plasma membrane-bound sphingomyelin metabolism in skeletal homeostasis.},

Determinants of macrophage intrinsic bacterial control, and the Mtb strategies to overcome them, are poorly understood. To further study these processes, we used an affinity tag purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to identify 187 Mtb-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving 34 secreted Mtb proteins. This interaction map revealed two factors involved in Mtb pathogenesis—the secreted Mtb protein, LpqN, and its binding partner, the human ubiquitin ligase CBL. We discovered that an lpqN Mtb mutant is attenuated in macrophages, but growth is restored when CBL is removed. Conversely, Cbl −/− macrophages are resistant to viral infection, indicating that CBL regulates cell-intrinsic polarization between antibacterial and antiviral immunity. Collectively, these findings illustrate the utility of this Mtb-human PPI map for developing a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between Mtb and its host. Penn et al. used an affinity tag purification mass spectrometry approach to generate an Mtb-human protein-protein interaction map, uncovering a connection between LpqN, a virulence factor in Mtb, and CBL, a host ubiquitin ligase. CBL suppresses lpqN attenuation and acts as a switch for host antibacterial and antiviral responses.},

  abstract = {Many pathogens deliver virulence factors or effectors into host cells in order to evade host defenses and establish infection. Although such effector proteins disrupt critical cellular signaling pathways, they also trigger specific antipathogen responses, a process termed “effector-triggered immunity.” The Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Yersinia inactivates critical proteins of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascade, thereby blocking inflammatory cytokine production but also inducing apoptosis. Yersinia -induced apoptosis requires the kinase activity of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), a key regulator of cell death, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling. Through the targeted disruption of RIPK1 kinase activity, which selectively disrupts RIPK1-dependent cell death, we now reveal that Yersinia -induced apoptosis is critical for host survival, containment of bacteria in granulomas, and control of bacterial burdens in vivo. We demonstrate that this apoptotic response provides a cell-extrinsic signal that promotes optimal innate immune cytokine production and antibacterial defense, demonstrating a novel role for RIPK1 kinase–induced apoptosis in mediating effector-triggered immunity to circumvent pathogen inhibition of immune signaling.},

Analysis of mycobacterial aerosol particles generated from bacterial suspensions revealed an average aerodynamic diameter and mass density that may allow distant airborne transmission. The volume and mass of mycobacterial aerosol particles increased with elevated relative humidity. To more closely mimic aerosol formation that occurs in active TB patients, aerosols from mycobacterium-infected neutrophils were analysed. Mycobacterium-infected intact neutrophils showed a smaller particle size distribution and lower viability than free mycobacteria. In contrast, mycobacterium-infected necrotic neutrophils, predominant in               M. tuberculosis               infection, revealed particle sizes and viability rates similar to those found for free mycobacteria, but in addition, larger aggregates of viable mycobacteria were observed. Therefore, mycobacteria are shielded from environmental stresses in multibacillary aggregates generated from necrotic neutrophils, which allows improved tenacity but emphasizes short distance transmission between close contacts.},

Here, we identify coronin 1A (Coro1A) as a novel regulator of β2 integrins that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 and is crucial for induction of PMN adhesion and postadhesion events, including adhesion strengthening, spreading, and migration under flow conditions. Transition of PMN rolling to firm adhesion critically depends on Coro1A by regulating the accumulation of high-affinity LFA-1 in focal zones of adherent cells. Defective integrin affinity regulation in the genetic absence of Coro1A impairs leukocyte adhesion and extravasation in inflamed cremaster muscle venules in comparison with control animals. In a Helicobacter pylori mouse infection model, PMN infiltration into the gastric mucosa is dramatically reduced in Coro1A -/- mice, resulting in an attenuated gastric inflammation. Thus, Coro1A represents an important novel player in integrin biology, with key functions in PMN trafficking during innate immunity.},

  abstract = {Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently the leading candidates for virus-based gene therapies because of their broad tissue tropism, non-pathogenic nature and low immunogenicity. They have been successfully used in clinical trials to treat hereditary diseases such as haemophilia B (ref. 2), and have been approved for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe. Considerable efforts have been made to engineer AAV variants with novel and biomedically valuable cell tropisms to allow efficacious systemic administration, yet basic aspects of AAV cellular entry are still poorly understood. In particular, the protein receptor(s) required for AAV entry after cell attachment remains unknown. Here we use an unbiased genetic screen to identify proteins essential for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) infection in a haploid human cell line. The most significantly enriched gene of the screen encodes a previously uncharacterized type I transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L (denoted hereafter as AAV receptor (AAVR)). We characterize AAVR as a protein capable of rapid endocytosis from the plasma membrane and trafficking to the trans-Golgi network. We show that AAVR directly binds to AAV2 particles, and that anti-AAVR antibodies efficiently block AAV2 infection. Moreover, genetic ablation of AAVR renders a wide range of mammalian cell types highly resistant to AAV2 infection. Notably, AAVR serves as a critical host factor for all tested AAV serotypes. The importance of AAVR for in vivo gene delivery is further highlighted by the robust resistance of Aavr(-/-) (also known as Au040320(-/-) and Kiaa0319l(-/-)) mice to AAV infection. Collectively, our data indicate that AAVR is a universal receptor involved in AAV infection.},

Accumulating evidence shows that Cers with different N - acyl chain composition differentially impact cell physiology, which may in part be due to specifi c alterations in membrane biophysical properties. We now address how the sphingolipid (SL) N -acyl chain affects membrane properties in cultured human embryonic kidney cells by overexpressing different Cer synthases (CerSs ). Our results show an increase in the order of cellular membranes in CerS2-transfected cells caused by the enrichment in very long acyl chain SLs. Formation of Cer upon treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase promoted sequential changes in the properties of the membranes: after an initial increase in the order of the fl uid plasma membrane, reorganization into domains with gel-like properties whose characteristics are dependent on the acyl chain structure of the Cer was observed. Moreover, the extent of alterations of membrane properties correlates with the amount of Cer formed. These data reinforce the signifi cance of Cer-induced changes on membrane biophysical properties as a likely molecular mechanism by which different acyl chain Cers exert their specifi c biological actions. © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

We first define an in vivo signature of 180 genes specifically upregulated by Mtb in mouse lung macrophages, then we uncover a divergent transcriptional response of the bacteria between alveolar macrophages that appear to sustain Mtb growth through increased access to iron and fatty acids and interstitial macrophages that restrict Mtb growth through iron sequestration and higher levels of nitric oxide. We use an enrichment protocol for bacterial transcripts, which enables us to probe Mtb physiology at the host cell level in an in vivo environment, with broader application in understanding the infection dynamics of intracellular pathogens in general.},

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization have been at the forefront of these developments. However, matrix application complicates the use of MALDI for cellular, tissue, biofluid and microarray analysis and can limit the spatial resolution because of the matrix crystal size (typically more than 10 mum), sensitivity and detection of small compounds (less than 500 Da). Secondary-ion mass spectrometry has extremely high lateral resolution (100 nm) and has found biological applications although the energetic desorption/ionization is a limitation owing to molecular fragmentation. Here we introduce nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), a tool for spatially defined mass analysis. NIMS uses 'initiator' molecules trapped in nanostructured surfaces or 'clathrates' to release and ionize intact molecules adsorbed on the surface. This surface responds to both ion and laser irradiation. The lateral resolution (ion-NIMS about 150 nm), sensitivity, matrix-free and reduced fragmentation of NIMS allows direct characterization of peptide microarrays, direct mass analysis of single cells, tissue imaging, and direct characterization of blood and urine.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. The development of much needed specific antiviral therapies and an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a convenient small animal model. The determinants restricting HCV tropism to human and chimpanzee hosts are unknown. Replication of the viral RNA has been demonstrated in mouse cells1,2, but these cells are not infectable with either lentiviral particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp)3 or HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc)(unpublished data), suggesting a block at the level of entry. Through an iterative cDNA library screening approach we have identified human occludin (OCLN) as an essential HCV cell entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCVpp. Similarly, OCLN is required for HCV-susceptibility of human cells, since its overexpression in uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCVpp uptake while its silencing in permissive cells impaired both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. In addition to OCLN, HCVpp infection of murine cells required expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors, CD814, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)5, and claudin-1 (CLDN1)6. While the mouse versions of SR-BI and CLDN1 function at least as well as the human proteins for promoting HCV entry; both OCLN and CD81, however, must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The species-specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second extracellular loop. The identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlights the importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process and provides a major advance towards efforts to develop small animal models for HCV.},

Such approaches are used for systems biology, functional genomics, and biomarker discovery, among others. An ongoing challenge of these molecular profiling approaches, however, is the development of better data processing methods. Here we introduce a new generation of a popular open-source data processing toolbox, MZmine 2.Results: A key concept of the MZmine 2 software design is the strict separation of core functionality and data processing modules, with emphasis on easy usability and support for high-resolution spectra processing. Data processing modules take advantage of embedded visualization tools, allowing for immediate previews of parameter settings. Newly introduced functionality includes the identification of peaks using online databases, MSndata support, improved isotope pattern support, scatter plot visualization, and a new method for peak list alignment based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The performance of the RANSAC alignment was evaluated using synthetic datasets as well as actual experimental data, and the results were compared to those obtained using other alignment algorithms.Conclusions: MZmine 2 is freely available under a GNU GPL license and can be obtained from the project website at: http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/. The current version of MZmine 2 is suitable for processing large batches of data and has been applied to both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses. © 2010 Pluskal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids, a family of membrane lipids, are bioactive molecules that participate in diverse functions controlling fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, differentiation, and cell death. Given that most of these cellular processes form the basis for several pathologies, it is not surprising that sphingolipids are key players in several pathological processes. This review discusses the role of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with a special emphasis on the changes in gene expression pattern in these disease conditions. For convenience, the sphingolipid metabolic pathway is divided into hypothetical compartments (modules) with each compartment representing a physiological process and changes in gene expression pattern are mapped to each of these modules. It appears that alterations in the gene expression pattern in these disease conditions are biased to manipulate the system in order to result in a particular disease.},

  abstract = {We have characterized the CD1b-mediated presentation pathway for the mycobacterial lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in monocyte-derived antigen-presenting cells. The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) was responsible for uptake of LAM. Antagonism of MR function inhibited both the internalization of LAM and the presentation of this antigen to LAM-reactive T cells. Intracellular MRs were most abundant in early endosomes, but they also were located in the compartment for MHC class II antigen loading (MIIC). Internalized LAM was transported to late endosomes, lysosomes, and MIICs. MRs colocalized with CD1b molecules, suggesting that the MR could deliver LAM to late endosomes for loading onto CD1b. LAM and CD1b colocalized in organelles that may be sites of lipoglycan antigen loading. This pathway links recognition of microbial antigens by a receptor of the innate immune system to the induction of adaptive T cell responses.},

In this study, RNA sequencing (transcriptome sequencing) was employed to investigate the global transcriptome changes in the macrophages during the different strains of M.tb infection. THP‐1 cells derived from macrophages were exposed to the virulent M.tb strain H37Rv (Rv) or the avirulent M.tb strain H37Ra (Ra), and the M.tb BCG vaccine strain was used as a control. The cDNA libraries were prepared from M.tb‐infected macrophages and then sequenced. To assess the transcriptional differences between the expressed genes, the bioinformatics analysis was performed using a standard pipeline of quality control, reference mapping, differential expression analysis, protein‐protein interaction (PPI) networks, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Q‐PCR and Western blot assays were also performed to validate the data. Our findings indicated that, when compared to BCG or M.tb H37Ra infection, the transcriptome analysis identified 66 differentially expressed genes in the M.tb H37Rv‐infected macrophages, out of which 36~genes were up‐regulated, and 30~genes were down‐regulated. The up‐regulated genes were associated with immune response regulation, chemokine secretion, and leucocyte chemotaxis. In contrast, the down‐regulated genes were associated with amino acid biosynthetic and energy metabolism, connective tissue development and extracellular matrix organization. The Q‐PCR and Western blot assays confirmed increased expression of pro‐inflammatory factors, altered energy metabolic processes, enhanced activation of pro‐inflammatory signalling pathways and increased pyroptosis in H37Rv‐infected macrophage. Overall, our RNA sequencing‐based transcriptome study successfully identified a comprehensive, in‐depth gene expression/regulation profile in M.tb‐infected macrophages. The results demonstrated that virulent M.tb strain H37Rv infection triggers a more severe inflammatory immune response associated with increased tissue damage, which helps in understanding the host‐pathogen interaction dynamics and pathogenesis features in different strains of M.tb infection.},

The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a secreted glycoprotein involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and vascular leakage during dengue virus infection. However, the contribution of secreted NS1 from related flaviviruses to viral pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NS1 from dengue, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses selectively binds to and alters permeability of human endothelial cells from lung, dermis, umbilical vein, brain, and liver in vitro and causes tissue-specific vascular leakage in mice, reflecting the pathophysiology of each flavivirus. Mechanistically, each flavivirus NS1 leads to differential disruption of endothelial glycocalyx components, resulting in endothelial hyperpermeability. Our findings reveal the capacity of a secreted viral protein to modulate endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner both in vitro and in vivo, potentially influencing virus dissemination and pathogenesis and providing targets for antiviral therapies and vaccine development.},

  abstract = {Quorum-sensing molecules (QSMs) are secreted by bacteria to signal population density. Upon reaching a critical concentration, QSMs induce transcriptional alterations in bacteria, which enable virulence factor expression and biofilm formation. It is unclear whether mammalian hosts can recognize QSMs to trigger responsive antibacterial immunity. We report that mouse mast-cell-specific G-protein-coupled receptor Mrgprb2 and its human homolog MRGPRX2 are receptors for Gram-positive QSMs, including competence-stimulating peptide (CSP)-1. CSP-1 activates Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2, triggering mast cell degranulation, which inhibits bacterial growth and prevents biofilm formation. Such antibacterial functions are reduced in Mrgprb2-deficient mast cells, while wild-type mast cells fail to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains lacking CSP-1. Mrgprb2-knockout mice exhibit reduced bacterial clearance, while pharmacologically activating Mrgprb2 in vivo eliminates bacteria and improves disease score. These findings identify a host defense mechanism that uses QSMs as an “Achilles heel” and suggest MRGPRX2 as a potential therapeutic target for controlling bacterial infections. Bacteria use quorum-sensing signaling for cross-species communication. Pundir et al. report that host mast cells detect Gram-positive-bacteria-derived quorum-sensing molecules via the Mrgpr receptors. Mrgpr activation triggers antibacterial activity and immune cell recruitment to efficiently clear bacteria, while animals deficient in Mrgpr are hypersusceptible to bacterial infection.},

Oxidative mechanisms include the action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates on bacteria. Non-oxidative mechanisms include the maturation of the phagosome into an acidified, hydrolytically active compartment as well as the action of antimicrobial peptides. Mycobacterium tuberculosis parasitizes the host macrophage by arresting the normal maturation of its phagosome and resides in a compartment that fails to fuse with lysosomes. When bacteria are unable to regulate phagosome maturation, such as in activated macrophages, they are delivered to lysosomal compartments, where they are killed. Recent data indicate that the antimycobacterial mechanism of the lysosome is due in part to the action of ubiquitin-derived peptides. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objective: HIV-1 uses CD4 and chemokine receptors to enter cells. However, other target membrane components may also be involved. This study examines the role of glycosphingolipids (GSL) in HIV-1 entry into primary lymphocytes and its modulation by an inhibitor of GSL biosynthesis. Methods: CD4 lymphocytes purified from normal or the p-group subtype individuals that were defective in Gb3 synthesis were treated with a GSL biosynthesis inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP). The PPMP-treated cells were tested for HIV-1 replication by measuring p24 antigen production for 7-14 days post-infection and for susceptibility to HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion monitored by a fluorescent dye transfer assay. The effects of PPMP treatment on HIV-1 binding to CD4 lymphocytes were also examined by measuring HIV-1 p24. Results: CD4 lymphocytes from p donors that are devoid of Gb3, but have elevated levels of GM3 were highly susceptible to HIV-1 fusion/entry. Pre-treatment of primary human CD4 lymphocytes from normal or p-sub-group type with PPMP, significantly reduced HIV-1 replication with no change in CD4 and CXCR4 levels. Inhibition of HIV-1 infection was due to the block in HIV-1 Env-mediated plasma membrane fusion. Binding of HIV-1 to CD4 lymphocytes was not affected by PPMP treatment. Conclusion: Manipulation of glycosphingolipid metabolic pathways may alter susceptibility of CD4 lymphocytes to HIV-1 entry. © 2004 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

In this study, targeted metabolomic and untargeted lipidomic profiling experiments were performed on the plasma, cortices, and hippocampi of wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic APdE9 mice after chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, as well as saline-treated APdE9 mice. The lipidome and the metabolome of these mice were compared to saline-treated WT animals. In the brain tissue of all three models, the lipidome was more influenced than the metabolome. The LPS-treated APdE9 mice had the highest number of changes in brain metabolic pathways with significant alterations in levels of lysine, myo-inositol, spermine, phosphocreatine, acylcarnitines and diacylglycerols, which were not observed in the saline-treated APdE9 mice. In the WT mice, the effect of the LPS administration on metabolome and lipidome was negligible. The study provided exciting information about the biochemical perturbations due to LPS-induced inflammation in the transgenic AD model, which can significantly enhance our understanding of the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathogenesis.},

GSLs impact numerous aspects of membrane biology, including membrane fluidity, curvature, and organization. The role of these molecules in both chronic inflammation and infectious disease and underlying pathogenic mechanisms are just starting to be recognized. As a component of the cell membrane, GSLs are also incorporated into lipid bilayers of diverse enveloped viruses as they bud out from the host cell and can go on to have a significant influence on viral pathogenesis. Dendritic cell (DC) subsets located in the peripheral mucosal tissues are proposed to be one of the earliest cell types that encounter transmitted viruses and help initiate adaptive immune responses against the invading pathogen by interacting with T cells. In turn, viruses, as obligatory intracellular parasites, rely on host cells for completing their replication cycle, and not surprisingly, HIV has evolved to exploit DC biology for the initial transmission event as well as for its dissemination and propagation within the infected host. In this review, we describe the mechanisms by which GSLs impact DC-mediated HIV trans-infection by either modulating virus infectivity, serving as a direct virus particle-associated host-derived ligand for specific interactions with DCs, or modulating the T cell membrane in such a way as to impact viral entry and thereby productive infection of CD4(+) T cells.},

Linear dextran applied as a blood plasma substitute demonstrates a high rate of biocompatibility. Dextran is present in foods, drugs, and vaccines and in most cases is applied as a biologically inert substance. In this review we analyze dextran's cellular uptake principles, receptor specificity and, therefore, its ability to interfere with pathogen-lectin interactions: a promising basis for new antimicrobial strategies. Dextran-binding receptors in humans include the DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) family receptors: DC-SIGN (CD209) and L-SIGN (the liver and lymphatic endothelium homologue of DC-SIGN), the mannose receptor (CD206), and langerin. These receptors take part in the uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells and macrophages and may also participate in the modulation of immune responses, mostly shown to be beneficial for pathogens per se rather than host(s). It is logical to predict that owing to receptor-specific interactions, dextran or its derivatives can interfere with these immune responses and improve infection outcome. Recent data support this hypothesis. We consider dextran a promising molecule for the development of lectin-glycan interaction-blocking molecules (such as DC-SIGN inhibitors) that could be applied in the treatment of diseases including tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS, etc. Dextran derivatives indeed change the pathology of infections dependent on DC-SIGN and mannose receptors. Complete knowledge of specific dextran-lectin interactions may also be important for development of future dextran applications in biological research and medicine.},

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a naturally occurring bioactive sphingolipid, which regulates the adhesion between the cells and the extracellular matrix and affects cell migration and differentiation. The goal of this study was to analyze the correlations among S100A4, S1P, and pulmonary function among COPD patients. Methods. All 139 serum samples and 15 lung specimens were collected in COPD patients and control subjects. S100A4 and S1P were detected in two groups. The markers of fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured in the lungs of COPD patients and control subjects. Results. The protein expression of S100A4 was higher in the lungs and serum of COPD patients than control cases. Additionally, serum S100A4 was inversely associated with pulmonary function among COPD patients. Meanwhile, collagen deposition and EMT nuclear transcription factors were elevated in the lungs of COPD patients. Moreover, the protein expression of S1P was increased in the serum of COPD patients. Serum S1P was gradually increased along with pulmonary function decline in COPD patients. Further correlation analysis revealed that serum S1P was negatively associated with pulmonary function in COPD patients. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between S1P and S100A4 in COPD patients. Conclusions. These results provide evidence that the elevation of S100A4 and S1P may be involved in the onset and progression of COPD.},

However, cells naturally produce even‐chain fatty acids (EcFAs) with negligible OcFAs. In the process of biosynthesis of fatty acids (FAs), the acetyl‐CoA serves as the starter unit for EcFAs, and propionyl‐CoA works as the starter unit for OcFAs. The lack of sufficient propionyl‐CoA, the precursor, is usually regarded as the main restriction for large‐scale bioproduction of OcFAs. In recent years, synthetic biology strategies have been used to modify several microorganisms to produce more propionyl‐CoA that would enable an efficient biosynthesis of OcFAs. This review discusses several reported and potential metabolic pathways for propionyl‐CoA biosynthesis, followed by advances in engineering several cell factories for OcFAs production. Finally, trends and challenges of synthetic biology driven OcFAs production are discussed.},

We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide RNA, generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells. This RNA-γuided DNA recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Sphingolipids and their metabolites perform a wide variety of cellular functions beyond energy metabolism. Emerging evidence based on genetically manipulated mouse models and molecular biology allows us to obtain new insights into the role sphingolipid played on skeletal remodeling. This review summarizes studies or understandings of the crosstalk between sphingomyelin, ceramide, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) of sphingolipids family and the cells, especially osteoblasts and osteoclasts of the bone through which bone is remodeled during life constantly. This review also shows agonists and antagonists of S1P as possible therapeutic options and opportunities on bone diseases.},

  abstract = {We have developed a simple and flexible mutation detection technology for the discovery and mapping of both known and unknown mutations. This technology is based on a new mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease from celery, Surveyor™ nuclease, which is a member of the CEL nuclease family of plant DNA endonucleases. Surveyor nuclease cleaves with high specificity at the 3′ side of any mismatch site in both DNA strands, including all base substitutions and insertion/deletions up to at least 12 nucleotides. Surveyor nuclease technology involves four steps: (i) PCR to amplify target DNA from both mutant and wild-type reference DNA; (ii) hybridization to form heteroduplexes between mutant and wild-type reference DNA; (iii) treatment of annealed DNA with Surveyor nuclease to cleave heteroduplexes; and (iv) analysis of digested DNA products using the detection/separation platform of choice. The technology is highly sensitive, detecting rare mutants present at as low as 1 in 32 copies. Unlabeled Surveyor nuclease digestion products can be analyzed using conventional gel electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while end-labeled digestion products are suitable for analysis by auto- mated gel or capillary electrophoresis. The entire protocol can be performed in less than a day and is suitable for automated and high-throughput procedures. INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids are a specialized group of lipids essential to the composition of the plasma membrane of many cell types; however, they are primarily localized within the nervous system. The amphipathic properties of sphingolipids enable their participation in a variety of intricate metabolic pathways. Sphingoid bases are the building blocks for all sphingolipid derivatives, comprising a complex class of lipids. The biosynthesis and catabolism of these lipids play an integral role in small- and large-scale body functions, including participation in membrane domains and signalling; cell proliferation, death, migration, and invasiveness; inflammation; and central nervous system development. Recently, sphingolipids have become the focus of several fields of research in the medical and biological sciences, as these bioactive lipids have been identified as potent signalling and messenger molecules. Sphingolipids are now being exploited as therapeutic targets for several pathologies. Here we present a comprehensive review of the structure and metabolism of sphingolipids and their many functional roles within the cell. In addition, we highlight the role of sphingolipids in several pathologies, including inflammatory disease, cystic fibrosis, cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and lysosomal storage disorders.},

Although the T-cell receptor (TCR) and LFA-1 can generate intracellular signals, the immune cell adaptor protein linker for the activation of T cells (LAT) couples the TCR to downstream events. Here, we show that LFA-1 can mediate both adhesion and de-adhesion, dependent on receptor clustering. Although increased affinity mediates adhesion, LFA-1 cross-linking induced the association and activation of the protein-tyrosine kinases FAK1/PYK1 that phosphorylated LAT selectively on a single Y-171 site for the binding to adaptor complex GRB-2-SKAP1. LAT-GRB2-SKAP1 complexes were distinct from canonical LAT-GADs-SLP-76 complexes. LFA-1 cross-linking increased the presence of LAT-GRB2-SKAP1 complexes relative to LAT-GADs-SLP-76 complexes. LFA-1-FAK1 decreased T-cell-dendritic cell (DC) dwell times dependent on LAT-Y171, leading to reduced DO11.10 T cell binding to DCs and proliferation to OVA peptide. Overall, our findings outline a new model for LFA-1 in which the integrin can mediate both adhesion and de-adhesion events dependent on receptor cross-linking.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Lysosome integrity is essential for cell viability, and lesions in lysosome membranes are repaired by the ESCRT machinery. Here, we describe an additional mechanism for lysosome repair that is activated independently of ESCRT recruitment. Lipidomic analyses showed increases in lysosomal phosphatidylserine and cholesterol after damage. Electron microscopy demonstrated that lysosomal membrane damage is rapidly followed by the formation of contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which depends on the ER proteins VAPA/B. The cholesterol‐binding protein ORP1L was recruited to damaged lysosomes, accompanied by cholesterol accumulation by a mechanism that required VAP–ORP1L interactions. The PtdIns 4‐kinase PI4K2A rapidly produced PtdIns4P on lysosomes upon damage, and knockout of PI4K2A inhibited damage‐induced accumulation of ORP1L and cholesterol and led to the failure of lysosomal membrane repair. The cholesterol–PtdIns4P transporter OSBP was also recruited upon damage, and its depletion caused lysosomal accumulation of PtdIns4P and resulted in cell death. We conclude that ER contacts are activated on damaged lysosomes in parallel to ESCRTs to provide lipids for membrane repair, and that PtdIns4P generation and removal are central in this response.           ,              Synopsis                                                                image                                                                         Lysosome integrity is essential for cell survival, and ruptures in lysosome membranes are repaired by the ESCRT machinery. This study identifies an additional, ESCRT‐independent repair mechanism that involves cholesterol transfer mediated by contact sites between lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).                                                   Upon lysosome damage, the ER proteins VAPA/B form contacts between ER and lysosomes and recruit the cholesterol‐binding protein ORP1L.                                                     PI4K2A‐dependent accumulation of PtdIns4P on the damaged lysosomes is essential for ORP1L recruitment and lysosome repair.                                                     ORP1L induces cholesterol accumulation on damaged lysosomes.                                                     Depletion of the cholesterol–PtdIns4P transporter OSBP causes PtdIns4P hyperaccumulation on damaged lysosomes and impairs cell viability.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis employs several strategies to combat and adapt to adverse conditions encountered inside the host. The non-replicative dormant state of the bacterium is linked to drug resistance and slower response to anti-tubercular therapy. It is known that alterations in lipid content allow dormant bacteria to acclimatize to cellular stress. Employing comparative lipidomic analysis we profiled the changes in lipid metabolism~in M. tuberculosis using a modified Wayne’s model of hypoxia-induced dormancy. Further we subjected the dormant bacteria to resuscitation, and analyzed their lipidomes until the lipid profile was~similar to that of normoxially grown bacteria. An enhanced degradation of cell wall-associated and cytoplasmic lipids during dormancy, and their gradual restoration during reactivation, were clearly evident. This study throws light on distinct lipid metabolic patterns that M. tuberculosis undergoes to maintain its cellular energetics during dormancy and reactivation.},

  abstract = {Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can enter cells via endocytic pathways or direct fusion at the plasma membrane depending on the cell line and receptor(s). Most studies into virus entry have used cultured fibroblasts but since keratinocytes represent the primary entry site for HSV-1 infection in its human host, we initiated studies to characterize the entry pathway of HSV-1 into human keratinocytes. Electron microscopy studies visualized free capsids in the cytoplasm and enveloped virus particles in vesicles suggesting viral uptake both by direct fusion at the plasma membrane and by endocytic vesicles. The ratio of the two entry modes differed in primary human keratinocytes and in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Inhibitor studies further support a role for endocytosis during HSV-1 entry. Infection was inhibited by the cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which demonstrates the requirement for host cholesterol during virus entry. Since the dynamin-specific inhibitor dynasore and overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant blocked infection, we conclude that the entry pathways into keratinocytes are dynamin-mediated. Electron microscopy studies confirmed that virus uptake is completely blocked when the GTPase activity of dynamin is inhibited. Ex vivo infection of murine epidermis that was treated with dynasore further supports the essential role of dynamin during entry into the epithelium. Thus, we conclude that HSV-1 can enter human keratinocytes by alternative entry pathways that require dynamin and host cholesterol. © 2011 Rahn et al.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that the acyl-chain is an important determinant of ceramide function, such that a small subset of ceramides (e.g., those containing the C16 or C18 acyl-chain) alter metabolism by inhibiting insulin signaling or inducing mitochondrial fragmentation. Herein I discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting certain ceramide synthase isoforms for the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis, and other metabolic disorders.},

The MR is highly expressed on human macrophages, regulating endocytosis, phagocytosis, and immune responses and mediating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) phagocytosis by human macrophages, thereby limiting phagosome-lysosome (P-L) fusion. We identified human MR-associated proteins using phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MR cytoplasmic tail peptides. We found that MR binds FcRγ-chain, which is required for MR plasma membrane localization and M.tb cell association. Additionally, we discovered that MR-mediated M.tb association triggers immediate MR tyrosine residue phosphorylation and Grb2 recruitment, activating the Rac/Pak/Cdc-42 signaling cascade important for M.tb uptake. MR activation subsequently recruits SHP-1 to the M.tb-containing phagosome, where its activity limits PI(3)P generation at the phagosome and M.tb P-L fusion and promotes M.tb growth. In sum, we identify human MR signaling pathways that temporally regulate phagocytosis and P-L fusion during M.tb infection. The human mannose receptor (MR) mediates macrophage phagocytosis and immune regulation. MR-specific signaling remains a major gap in the field. Rajaram et al. identify the importance of FcRγ-chain and Grb2 during MR-mediated phagocytosis and subsequent MR-dependent recruitment of SHP-1 to the M.tb phagosome, thereby limiting PI(3)P generation and phagosome-lysosome fusion.},

  abstract = {Malignant transformation, driven by gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations in tumour suppressor genes, results in cell deregulation that is frequently associated with enhanced cellular stress (for example, oxidative, replicative, metabolic and proteotoxic stress, and DNA damage). Adaptation to this stress phenotype is required for cancer cells to survive, and consequently cancer cells may become dependent upon non-oncogenes that do not ordinarily perform such a vital function in normal cells. Thus, targeting these non-oncogene dependencies in the context of a transformed genotype may result in a synthetic lethal interaction and the selective death of cancer cells. Here we used a cell-based small-molecule screening and quantitative proteomics approach that resulted in the unbiased identification of a small molecule that selectively kills cancer cells but not normal cells. Piperlongumine increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic cell death in both cancer cells and normal cells engineered to have a cancer genotype, irrespective of p53 status, but it has little effect on either rapidly or slowly dividing primary normal cells. Significant antitumour effects are observed in piperlongumine-treated mouse xenograft tumour models, with no apparent toxicity in normal mice. Moreover, piperlongumine potently inhibits the growth of spontaneously formed malignant breast tumours and their associated metastases in mice. Our results demonstrate the ability of a small molecule to induce apoptosis selectively in cells that have a cancer genotype, by targeting a non-oncogene co-dependency acquired through the expression of the cancer genotype in response to transformation-induced oxidative stress.},

In this work we investigated               M. tuberculosis               SigM, a member of the extracytoplasmic function subfamily of alternative sigma factors. This sigma factor is expressed at low levels in vitro and does not appear to function in stress response regulation. Instead, SigM positively regulates genes required for the synthesis of surface or secreted molecules. Among these are genes encoding two pairs of Esx secreted proteins, a multisubunit nonribosomal peptide synthetase operon, and genes encoding two members of the proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) family of proteins. Genes up regulated in a               sigM               mutant strain include a different PPE gene, as well as several genes involved in surface lipid synthesis. Among these are genes involved in synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a surface lipid critical for virulence during acute infection, and the               kasA-kasB               operon, which is required for mycolic acid synthesis. Analysis of surface lipids showed that PDIM synthesis is increased in a               sigM               -disrupted strain and is undetectable in a               sigM               overexpression strain. These findings demonstrate that SigM positively and negatively regulates cell surface and secreted molecules that are likely to function in host-pathogen interactions.},

Two prohibitin homologues, Phb1 and Phb2, assemble into a high molecular weight complex of 1.2 MDa in the mitochondrial inner membrane, but a nuclear localization of Phb1 and Phb2 also has been reported. Here, we have analyzed the biogenesis and structure of the prohibitin complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both Phb1 and Phb2 subunits are targeted to mitochondria by uncon-ventional noncleavable targeting sequences at their amino terminal end. Membrane insertion involves binding of newly imported Phb1 to Tim8/13 complexes in the intermembrane space and is mediated by the TIM23-translocase. Assembly occurs via intermediate-sized complexes of 120 kDa containing both Phb1 and Phb2. Conserved carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions in both subunits mediate the formation of large assemblies in the inner membrane. Single particle electron microscopy of purified prohibitin complexes identifies diverse ring-shaped structures with outer dimensions of 270 200 Å. Implications of these findings for proposed cellular activities of prohibitins are discussed.},

To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.},

Methods of mediating the RNAi effect involve small interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and bi-functional shRNA. The simplicity of siRNA manufacturing and transient nature of the effect per dose are optimally suited for certain medical disorders (i.e. viral injections). However, using the endogenous processing machinery, optimized shRNA constructs allow for high potency and sustainable effects using low copy numbers resulting in less off-target effects, particularly if embedded in a miRNA scaffold. Bi-functional design may further enhance potency and safety of RNAi-based therapeutics. Remaining challenges include tumor selective delivery vehicles and more complete evaluation of the scope and scale of off-target effects.

  abstract = {GM3, a major ganglioside of T lymphocytes, promotes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry via interactions with HIV-1 receptors and the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Increased GM3 levels in T lymphocytes and the appearance of anti-GM3 antibodies in AIDS patients have been reported earlier. In this study, we investigated the effect of GM3 regulation on HIV-1 entry by utilizing a mouse cell line (B16F10), which expresses exceptionally high levels of GM3. Strikingly, B16 cells bearing CD4, CXCR4, and/or CCR5 were highly resistant to CD4-dependent HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion. In contrast, these targets supported membrane fusion mediated by CD4-requiring HIV-2, SIV, and CD4-independent HIV-1 Envs. Coreceptor function was not impaired by GM3 overexpression as indicated by Ca 2+ fluxes mediated by the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1α and the CCR5 ligand MIP-1β. Reduction in GM3 levels of B16 target cells resulted in a significant recovery of CD4-dependent HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. We propose that GM3 in the plasma membrane blocks HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion by interfering with the lateral association of HIV-1 receptors. Our findings offer a novel mechanism of interplay between membrane lipids and receptors by which host cells may escape viral infections.},

  abstract = {Current studies involve an investigation of the role of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in membrane targeting and activation of phospholipase Cβ 1  (PLCβ 1 ). Here we report studies on the membrane localization of the isolated PH domain from the amino terminus of PLCβ 1  (PLCβ 1 -PH) using fluorescence microscopy of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Whereas PLCβ 1 -PH does not localize to the plasma membrane in serum-starved cells, it undergoes a rapid but transient migration to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of cells with serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Regulation of the plasma membrane localization of PLCβ 1 -PH by phosphoinositides was also investigated. PLCβ 1 -PH was found to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate most strongly, whereas other phosphoinositides were bound with lower affinity. The plasma membrane localization of PLCβ 1 -PH induced by serum and LPA was blocked by wortmannin pretreatment and by LY294002. In parallel, activation of PLCβ by LPA was inhibited by wortmannin, by LY294002, or by the overexpression of PLCβ 1 -PH. Microinjection of βγ subunits of G proteins in serum-starved cells induced the translocation of PLCβ 1 -PH to the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate that a cooperative mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and the Gβγ subunit regulates the plasma membrane localization and activation of PLCβ 1 -PH.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipid involvement in infectious disease is a new and exciting branch of research. Various microbial pathogens have been shown to synthesize their own sphingolipids and some have evolved methods to "hijack" host sphingolipids for their own use. For instance, Sphingomonas species are bacterial pathogens that lack the lipopolysaccharide component typical but instead contain glycosphingolipids (Kawahara 1991, 2006). In terms of sphingolipid signaling and function, perhaps the best-studied group of microbes is the pathogenic fungi. Pathogenic fungi still represent significant problems in human disease, despite treatments that have been used for decades. Because fungi are eukaryotic, drug targets in fungi can have many similarities to mammalian processes. This often leads to significant side effects of antifungal drugs that can be dose limiting in many patient populations. The search for fungal-specific drugs and the need for better understanding of cellular processes of pathogenic fungi has led to a large body of research on fungal signaling. One particularly interesting and rapidly growing field in this research is the involvement of fungal sphingolipid pathways in signaling and virulence. In this chapter, the research relating to sphingolipid signaling pathogenic fungi will be reviewed and summarized, in addition to highlighting pathways that show promise for future research. © 2010 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is a fascinating process whereby a cell surrounds and engulfs particles such as bacteria and dead cells. This is crucial both for single-cell organisms (as a way of acquiring nutrients) and as part of the immune system (to destroy foreign invaders). This whole process is hugely complex and involves multiple coordinated events such as membrane remodelling, receptor motion, cytoskeleton reorganisation and intracellular signalling. Because of this, phagocytosis is an excellent system for theoretical study, benefiting from biophysical approaches combined with mathematical modelling. Here, we review these theoretical approaches and discuss the recent mathematical and computational models, including models based on receptors, models focusing on the forces involved, and models employing energetic considerations. Along the way, we highlight a beautiful connection to the physics of phase transitions, consider the role of stochasticity, and examine links between phagocytosis and other types of endocytosis. We cover the recently discovered multistage nature of phagocytosis, showing that the size of the phagocytic cup grows in distinct stages, with an initial slow stage followed by a much quicker second stage starting around half engulfment. We also address the issue of target shape dependence, which is relevant to both pathogen infection and drug delivery, covering both one-dimensional and two-dimensional results. Throughout, we pay particular attention to recent experimental techniques that continue to inform the theoretical studies and provide a means to test model predictions. Finally, we discuss population models, connections to other biological processes, and how physics and modelling will continue to play a key role in future work in this area.},

Candida albicans is the most commonly encountered fungal pathogen of humans, and is frequently found on the mucosal surfaces of the body.

Central to this protection are the adaptive Th1 and Th17 cellular responses, which are considered paramount to successful immune defense against C. albicans infections, and enable tissue homeostasis to be maintained in the presence of colonising fungi. This review will highlight the recent advances in our understanding of adaptive immunity to Candida albicans infections.},

We differentially permeabilized cells with low concentrations of saponin, at which secretory proteins rinsed out completely, whereas integral membrane proteins were not released. All relevant intracellular compartments were shown to be permeabilized by saponin. Metabolic labeling showed that early precursors of cathepsin D, sphingolipid activating protein, and glucocerebrosidase were completely released from the cells, whereas more than 80\% of the high molecular mass intermediates were retained by the cells. Treatment of permeabilized cells with 10 mM mannose 6-phosphate released only 50\% of the cell-associated cathepsin D. Glucocerebrosidase remained membrane-associated, but cathepsin D and sphingolipid activating protein were released from the cells after proteolytic processing. Sphingolipid activating proteins and cathepsin D behaved similarly during biosynthesis and showed similar sensitivity to mannose 6-phosphate. The membrane association of the intermediate form of cathepsin D was independent of the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides. Subcellular fractionation on sucrose gradients showed that the lysosomal proteins became membrane-associated probably in the Golgi complex, and that both mannose 6-phosphate-dependent and mannose 6-phosphate-independent membrane association occur in the same compartments. We conclude that, in HepG2 cells, cathepsin D, sphingolipid activating protein, and glucocerebrosidase exhibit MPR-independent membrane association which is acquired in the same compartments beyond the rough endoplasmic reticulum.},

  abstract = {Fumonisins are mycotoxins that cause diseases of plants and, when consumed by animals, can damage liver, kidney, lung, brain, and other organs, alter immune function, and cause developmental defects and cancer. They structurally resemble sphingolipids (SLs), and studies nearly 30 years ago discovered that the most prevalent fumonisin [fumonisin B1 (FB1)] potently inhibits ceramide synthases (CerSs), enzymes that use fatty acyl-CoAs to N-acylate sphinganine (Sa), sphingosine (So), and other sphingoid bases. CerS inhibition by FB1 triggers a “perfect storm” of perturbations in structural and signaling SLs that include: reduced formation of dihydroceramides, ceramides, and complex SLs; elevated Sa and So and their 1-phosphates, novel 1-deoxy-sphingoid bases; and alteration of additional lipid metabolites from interrelated pathways. Moreover, because the initial enzyme of sphingoid base biosynthesis remains active (sometimes with increased activity), the impact is multiplied by the continued production of damaging metabolites. Evidence from many studies, including characterization of knockout mice for specific CerSs and analyses of human blood (which found that FB1 intake is associated with elevated Sa 1-phosphate), has consistently pointed to CerS as the proximate target of FB1. It is also apparent that the changes in multiple bioactive lipids and related biologic processes account for the ensuing spectrum of animal and plant disease. Thus, the diseases caused by fumonisins can be categorized as “sphingolipidoses” (in these cases, due to defective SL biosynthesis), and the lessons learned about the consequences of CerS inhibition should be borne in mind when contemplating other naturally occurring and synthetic compounds (and genetic manipulations) that interfere with SL metabolism.—Riley, R.

The development of a vaccine is likely to require at least 12-18~months, and the typical timeline for approval of a novel antiviral therapeutic can exceed 10~years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could significantly accelerate the deployment of novel therapies for COVID-19. Towards this end, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000~clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. We report the identification of 100~molecules that inhibit viral replication, including 21~known drugs that exhibit dose response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbor effective concentrations likely commensurate with achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod(2-4), and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334, and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human iPSC-derived pneumocyte-like cells, and the PIKfyve inhibitor also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.},

Here, we review the role of transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism including liver X receptors α/β, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, estrogen receptors α/β (ERα/β), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins in T-cells. These receptors lie at the interface between lipid metabolism and immune cell function and are endogenously activated by lipids and/or hormones. Importantly, they regulate cellular cholesterol, fatty acid, glycosphingolipid, and phospholipid levels but are also known to modulate a broad spectrum of immune responses. The current evidence supporting a role for lipid metabolism pathways in controlling immune cell activation by influencing PM lipid raft composition in health and disease, and the potential for targeting lipid biosynthesis pathways to control unwanted T-cell activation in autoimmunity is reviewed.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) constitutes a critical host defense against tuberculosis, but its excess is also implicated in tuberculosis pathogenesis in zebrafish and humans. Using the zebrafish, we elucidate the pathways by which TNF mediates tuberculosis pathogenesis. TNF excess induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected macrophages through RIP1-RIP3-dependent pathways. While initially increasing macrophage microbicidal activity, ROS rapidly induce programmed necrosis (necroptosis) and release mycobacteria into the growth-permissive extracellular milieu. TNF-induced necroptosis occurs through two pathways: modulation of mitochondrial cyclophilin D, implicated in mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation, and acid sphingomyelinase-mediated ceramide production. Combined genetic blockade of cyclophilin D and acid sphingomyelinase renders the high TNF state hyperresistant by preventing macrophage necrosis while preserving increased microbicidal activity. Similarly, the cyclophilin D-inhibiting drug alisporivir and the acid sphingomyelinase-inactivating drug, desipramine, synergize to reverse susceptibility, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these orally active drugs against tuberculosis and possibly other TNF-mediated diseases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Necrosis of infected macrophages constitutes a critical pathogenetic event in tuberculosis by releasing mycobacteria into the growth-permissive extracellular environment. In zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, excess tumor necrosis factor triggers programmed necrosis of infected macrophages through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the participation of cyclophilin D, a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Here, we show that this necrosis pathway is not mitochondrion-intrinsic but results from an inter-organellar circuit initiating and culminating in the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ROS induce production of lysosomal ceramide that ultimately activates the cytosolic protein BAX. BAX promotes calcium flow from the endoplasmic reticulum into the mitochondrion through ryanodine receptors, and the resultant mitochondrial calcium overload triggers cyclophilin-D-mediated necrosis. We identify ryanodine receptors and plasma membrane L-type calcium channels as druggable targets to intercept mitochondrial calcium overload and necrosis of mycobacterium-infected zebrafish and human macrophages.},

  abstract = {Trypanosoma~cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease. The only two drugs accepted for the treatment of this infection are benznidazole and nifurtimox, which are of limited use in the predominant chronic phase. On the search for new drugs, the intracellular Ca2+ regulation has been postulated as a possible target, due to differences found between host cells and the parasite. The mechanisms involved in the intracellular Ca2+ regulation of T.~cruzi have been partially elucidated. However, nothing is known about a putative channel responsible for the Ca2+ entry into this parasite. In contrast, in Leishmania spp., a closely related hemoflagelate, a sphingosine-activated plasma membrane Ca2+ channel has been recently described. The latter resembles the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel present in humans, but with distinct characteristics. This channel is one of the main targets concerning the mechanism of action of miltefosine, the unique oral drug approved against leishmaniasis. In the present work, we describe for the first time, the electrophysiological characterization of a sphingosine-activated Ca2+ channel of T.~cruzi by reconstituting plasma membrane vesicles into giant liposomes and patch clamp. This channel shares some characteristic as activation by Bay K8644 and inhibition by channel blockers such as nifedipine. However, the T.~cruzi channel differs from the L-type VGCC in its activation by sphingosine and/or miltefosine. Albeit the conductance for each, Ba2+, Ca2+ and Sr2+ was similar, the parasite channel appears not to be voltage dependent. A gene that presents homology in critical amino acids with its human ortholog Ca2+ channel was identified.},

  abstract = {Trypanosome parasites control their virulence and spread by using quorum sensing (QS) to generate transmissible “stumpy forms” in their host bloodstream. However, the QS signal “stumpy induction factor” (SIF) and its reception mechanism are unknown. Although trypanosomes lack G protein-coupled receptor signaling, we have identified a surface GPR89-family protein that regulates stumpy formation. TbGPR89 is expressed on bloodstream “slender form” trypanosomes, which receive the SIF signal, and when ectopically expressed, TbGPR89 drives stumpy formation in a SIF-pathway-dependent process. Structural modeling of TbGPR89 predicts unexpected similarity to oligopeptide transporters (POT), and when expressed in bacteria, TbGPR89 transports oligopeptides. Conversely, expression of an E. coli POT in trypanosomes drives parasite differentiation, and oligopeptides promote stumpy formation in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of secreted trypanosome oligopeptidases generates a paracrine signal that accelerates stumpy formation in vivo. Peptidase-generated oligopeptide QS signals being received through TbGPR89 provides a mechanism for both trypanosome SIF production and reception.},

  abstract = {Autophagy is an essential component of innate immunity, enabling the detection and elimination of intracellular pathogens. Legionella pneumophila, an intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia in humans, is able to modulate autophagy through the action of effector proteins that are translocated into the host cell by the pathogen's Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. Many of these effectors share structural and sequence similarity with eukaryotic proteins. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses have indicated their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic host. Here we report that L. pneumophila translocates the effector protein sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (LpSpl) to target the host sphingosine biosynthesis and to curtail autophagy. Our structural characterization of LpSpl and its comparison with human SPL reveals high structural conservation, thus supporting prior phylogenetic analysis. We show that LpSpl possesses S1P lyase activity that was abrogated by mutation of the catalytic site residues. L. pneumophila triggers the reduction of several sphingolipids critical for macrophage function in an LpSpl-dependent and -independent manner. LpSpl activity alone was sufficient to prevent an increase in sphingosine levels in infected host cells and to inhibit autophagy during macrophage infection. LpSpl was required for efficient infection of A/J mice, highlighting an important virulence role for this effector. Thus, we have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanism used by intracellular pathogens to inhibit autophagy, namely the disruption of host sphingolipid biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {One hundred years have passed since the death of Élie Metchnikoff (1845–1916). He was the first to observe the uptake of particles by cells and realized the importance of this process for the host response to injury and infection. He also was a strong advocate of the role of phagocytosis in cellular immunity, and with this he gave us the basis for our modern understanding of inflammation and the innate and acquired immune responses. Phagocytosis is an elegant but complex process for the ingestion and elimination of pathogens, but it is also important for the elimination of apoptotic cells and hence fundamental for tissue homeostasis. Phagocytosis can be divided into four main steps: (i) recognition of the target particle, (ii) signaling to activate the internalization machinery, (iii) phagosome formation, and (iv) phagolysosome maturation. In recent years, the use of new tools of molecular biology and microscopy has provided new insights into the cellular mechanisms of phagocytosis. In this review, we present a general view of our current knowledge on phagocytosis. We emphasize novel molecular findings, particularly on phagosome formation and maturation, and discuss aspects that remain incompletely understood.},

Named BioID for proximitydependent biotin identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. BioID features proximitydependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment. © 2012 Roux et al.},

These include a possible function of lysosomes as a cellular storage compartment, yet unidentified transporters mediating the export such as various amino acids, mechanisms mediating the transport of lysosomal membrane proteins from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes, and the turnover of lysosomal membrane proteins.

We show that variants on the T2D-associated haplotype have two distinct effects: (1) decreasing SLC16A11 expression in liver and (2) disrupting a key interaction with basigin, thereby reducing cell-surface localization. Both independent mechanisms reduce SLC16A11 function and suggest SLC16A11 is the causal gene at this locus. To gain insight into how SLC16A11 disruption impacts T2D risk, we demonstrate that SLC16A11 is a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter and that genetic perturbation of SLC16A11 induces changes in fatty acid and lipid metabolism that are associated with increased T2D risk. Our findings suggest that increasing SLC16A11 function could be therapeutically beneficial for T2D. Video Abstract [Figure presented]},

While the prevalent view of pulmonary T cell responses is based on peptide recognition by antigen receptors, called T cell receptors (TCR), on the T cell surface in the context of classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, novel pathways involving the presentation of lipid antigens by cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) molecules to lipid-reactive T cells are emerging as key players in pulmonary immune system. Whereas, genetic conservation of group II CD1 (CD1d) in mouse and human genomes facilitated numerous in vivo studies of CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung diseases, the recent development of human CD1-transgenic mice has made it possible to examine the physiological roles of group I CD1 (CD1a-c) molecules in lung immunity. Here, we discuss current understanding of the biology of CD1-reactive T cells with a specific focus on their roles in several pulmonary disorders.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$} Bacteria can inhibit the growth of other bacteria by injecting effectors using a type VI secretion system (T6SS). T6SS effectors can also be injected into eukaryotic cells to facilitate bacterial survival, often by targeting the cytoskeleton. Here, we show that the trans-kingdom antimicrobial T6SS effector VgrG4 from {$<$}italic{$>$}Klebsiella pneumoniae{$<$}/italic{$>$} triggers the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. VgrG4 colocalizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein mitofusin 2. VgrG4 induces the transfer of Ca \textsuperscript{2+} from the ER to the mitochondria, activating Drp1 (a regulator of mitochondrial fission) thus leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation. Ca \textsuperscript{2+} elevation also induces the activation of the innate immunity receptor NLRX1 to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). NLRX1-induced ROS limits NF-κB activation by modulating the degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. The degradation of IκBα is triggered by the ubiquitin ligase SCF \textsuperscript{β-TrCP} , which requires the modification of the cullin-1 subunit by NEDD8. VgrG4 abrogates the NEDDylation of cullin-1 by inactivation of Ubc12, the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme. Our work provides an example of T6SS manipulation of eukaryotic cells via alteration of the mitochondria. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Lysosomal homeostasis in the host is adaptable and responds to conditions such as infection or nutritional deprivation. Pathogens such as               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (               Mtb               ) and               Salmonella               avoid lysosomal targeting by actively manipulating the host vesicular trafficking and reside in a vacuole altered from the default lysosomal trafficking. In this review, the mechanisms by which the respective pathogen containing vacuoles (PCVs) intersect with lysosomal trafficking pathways and maintain their distinctness are discussed. Despite such active inhibition of lysosomal targeting, emerging literature shows that different pathogens or pathogen derived products exhibit a global influence on the host lysosomal system. Pathogen mediated lysosomal enrichment promotes the trafficking of a sub-set of pathogens to lysosomes, indicating heterogeneity in the host-pathogen encounter. This review integrates recent advancements on the global lysosomal alterations upon infections and the host protective role of the lysosomes against these pathogens. The review also briefly discusses the heterogeneity in the lysosomal targeting of these pathogens and the possible mechanisms and consequences.},

  abstract = {The topic of ceramidases has experienced an enormous boost during the last few years. Ceramidases catalyze the degradation of ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acids. Ceramide is not only the central hub of sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation, it is also a key molecule in sphingolipid signaling, promoting differentiation or apoptosis. Acid ceramidase inhibition sensitizes certain types of cancer to chemo- and radio-therapy and this is suggestive of a role of acid ceramidase inhibitors as chemo-sensitizers which can act synergistically with chemo-therapeutic drugs. In this review, we summarize the development of ceramide analogues as first-generation ceramidase inhibitors together with data on their activity in cells and disease models. Furthermore, we describe the recent developments that have led to highly potent second-generation ceramidase inhibitors that act at nanomolar concentrations. In the third part, various assays of ceramidases are described and their relevance for accurately measuring ceramidase activities and for the development of novel inhibitors is highlighted. Besides potential clinical implications, the recent improvements in ceramidase inhibition and assaying may help to better understand the mechanisms of ceramide biology.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection alters macrophage gene expression and macrophage response to IFN-γ, a critical host defense cytokine. However, regulation of these changes is poorly understood. We report discordance of changes in nascent transcript and total nuclear RNA abundance for the transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1, together with lack of effect on their RNA half-lives, in human THP-1 cells infected with M. tuberculosis and stimulated with IFN-γ. The results indicate that negative postinitiation regulation of mRNA biogenesis limits the expression of these factors, which mediate host defense against M. tuberculosis through the cellular response to IFN-γ. Consistent with the results for STAT1 and IRF1, transcriptome analysis reveals downregulation of postinitiation mRNA biogenesis processes and pathways by infection, with and without IFN-γ stimulation. Clinical relevance for regulation of postinitiation mRNA biogenesis is demonstrated by studies of donor samples showing that postinitiation mRNA biogenesis pathways are repressed in latent tuberculosis infection compared with cured disease and in active tuberculosis compared with ongoing treatment or with latent tuberculosis. For active disease and latent infection donors from two populations (London, U.K., and The Gambia), each analyzed using a different platform, pathway-related gene expression differences were highly correlated, demonstrating substantial specificity in the effect. Collectively, the molecular and bioinformatic analyses point toward downregulation of postinitiation mRNA biogenesis pathways as a means by which M. tuberculosis infection limits expression of immunologically essential transcription factors. Thus, negative regulation of postinitiation mRNA biogenesis can constrain the macrophage response to infection and overall host defense against tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Bedridden patients in intensive care unit or after surgery intervention commonly develop skeletal muscle weakness. The latter is promoted by a variety of prolonged hospitalization-associated conditions. Muscle disuse is the most ubiquitous and contributes to rapid skeletal muscle atrophy and progressive functional strength reduction. Disuse causes a reduction in fatty acid oxidation, leading to its accumulation in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that muscle fatty acid accumulation could stimulate ceramide synthesis and promote skeletal muscle weakness. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effects of sphingolipid metabolism on skeletal muscle atrophy induced by 7 days of disuse. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were treated with myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo synthesis of ceramides, and subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU) for 7 days. Soleus muscles were assayed for fiber diameter, ceramide levels, protein degradation, and apoptosis signaling. Serum and liver were removed to evaluate the potential hepatoxicity of myriocin treatment. We found that HU increases content of saturated C16:0 and C18:0 ceramides and decreases soleus muscle weight and fiber diameter. HU increased the level of polyubiquitinated proteins and induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Despite a prevention of C16:0 and C18:0 muscle accumulation, myriocin treatment did not prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and concomitant induction of apoptosis and proteolysis. Moreover, myriocin treatment increased serum transaminases and induced hepatocyte necrosis. These data highlight that inhibition of de novo synthesis of ceramides during immobilization is not an efficient strategy to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and exerts adverse effects like hepatotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Live vaccines have long been known to trigger far more vigorous immune responses than their killed counterparts1-6. This has been attributed to the ability of live microorganisms to replicate and express specialized virulence factors that facilitate invasion and infection of their hosts 7. However, protective immunization can often be achieved with a single injection of live, but not dead, attenuated microorganisms stripped of their virulence factors. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are detected by the immune system8,9, are present in both live and killed vaccines, indicating that certain poorly characterized aspects of live microorganisms, not incorporated in dead vaccines, are particularly effective at inducing protective immunity. Here we show that the mammalian innate immune system can directly sense microbial viability through detection of a special class of viability-associated PAMPs (vita-PAMPs). We identify prokaryotic messenger RNA as a vita-PAMP present only in viable bacteria, the recognition of which elicits a unique innate response and a robust adaptive antibody response. Notably, the innate response evoked by viability and prokaryotic mRNA was thus far considered to be reserved for pathogenic bacteria, but we show that even non-pathogenic bacteria in sterile tissues can trigger similar responses, provided that they are alive. Thus, the immune system actively gauges the infectious risk by searching PAMPs for signatures of microbial life and thus infectivity. Detection of vita-PAMPs triggers a state of alert not warranted for dead bacteria. Vaccine formulations that incorporate vita-PAMPs could thus combine the superior protection of live vaccines with the safety of dead vaccines. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Modern cell membranes contain a bewildering complexity of lipids, among them sphingolipids (SLs). Advances in mass spectrometry have led to the realization that the number and combinatorial complexity of lipids, including SLs, is much greater than previously appreciated. SLs are generated               de novo               by four enzymes, namely serine palmitoyltransferase, 3‐ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, ceramide synthase and dihydroceramide Δ4‐desaturase 1. Some of these enzymes depend on the availability of specific substrates and cofactors, which are themselves supplied by other complex metabolic pathways. The evolution of these four enzymes is poorly understood and likely depends on the co‐evolution of the metabolic pathways that supply the other essential reaction components. Here, we introduce the concept of the ‘anteome’, from the Latin               ante               (‘before’) to describe the network of metabolic (‘omic’) pathways that must have converged in order for these pathways to co‐evolve and permit SL synthesis. We also suggest that the current origin of life and evolutionary models lack appropriate experimental support to explain the appearance of this complex metabolic pathway and its anteome.},

  abstract = {Even though endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with mycobacterial infection has been well studied, the molecular basis of ER as a crucial organelle to determine the fate of               Mtb               is yet to be established. Here, we have studied the ability of               Mtb               to manipulate the ultrastructural architecture of macrophage ER and found that the ER-phenotypes associated with virulent (H37Rv) and avirulent (H37Ra) strains were different: a rough ER (RER) with the former against a smooth ER (SER) with the later. Further, the functional attributes of these changes were probed by MS-based quantitative proteomics (133 ER proteins) and lipidomics (8 phospholipids). Our omics approaches not only revealed the host pathogen cross-talk but also emphasized how precisely               Mtb               uses proteins and lipids in combination to give rise to characteristic ER-phenotypes. H37Ra-infected macrophages increased the cytosolic Ca               2+               levels by attenuating the ATP2A2 protein and simultaneous induction of PC/PE expression to facilitate apoptosis. However, H37Rv inhibited apoptosis and further controlled the expression of EST-1 and AMRP proteins to disturb cholesterol homeostasis resulting in sustained infection. This approach offers the potential to decipher the specific roles of ER in understanding the cell biology of mycobacterial infection with special reference to the impact of host response.},

  abstract = {Professional phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, effectively engulf and eliminate invading microorganisms. To survive this onslaught, pathogens have developed an astounding array of countermeasures aimed at avoiding detection, impairing signaling, or paralyzing the machinery that underlies phagocytosis. On the other hand, certain pathogens benefit from attaching to, entering, or traversing host cells to establish and spread infection. This is accomplished by yet other types of effectors that either co-opt or mimic host cell phagocytic components. Here, we briefly summarize the basic features of the phagocytic process and proceed to describe the types of strategies deployed by pathogens to either impair phagocytosis or to gain entry into cells where they can establish a safe survival niche. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Though superficially similar, the molecular mechanisms involved differ: engulfment of large targets requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), while that of small ones does not. Here, we report that inactivation of Rac and Cdc42 at phagocytic cups is essential to complete internalization of large particles. Through a screen of 62 RhoGAP-family members, we demonstrate that ARHGAP12, ARHGAP25 and SH3BP1 are responsible for GTPase inactivation. Silencing these RhoGAPs impairs phagocytosis of large targets. The GAPs are recruited to large--but not small--phagocytic cups by products of PI3K, where they synergistically inactivate Rac and Cdc42. Remarkably, the prominent accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate characteristic of large-phagosome formation is less evident during phagocytosis of small targets, accounting for the contrasting RhoGAP distribution and the differential requirement for PI3K during phagocytosis of dissimilarly sized particles.},

To assess the state of this organelle we captured the transcriptional responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in macrophages from wild-type and nitric oxide (NO) synthase 2–deficient mice before and after immunologic activation. The intraphagosomal transcriptome was compared with the transcriptome of MTB in standard broth culture and during growth in diverse conditions designed to simulate features of the phagosomal environment. Genes expressed differentially as a consequence of intraphagosomal residence included an interferon γ– and NO-induced response that intensifies an iron-scavenging program, converts the microbe from aerobic to anaerobic respiration, and induces a dormancy regulon. Induction of genes involved in the activation and β-oxidation of fatty acids indicated that fatty acids furnish carbon and energy. Induction of σE-dependent, sodium dodecyl sulfate–regulated genes and genes involved in mycolic acid modification pointed to damage and repair of the cell envelope. Sentinel genes within the intraphagosomal transcriptome were induced similarly by MTB in the lungs of mice. The microbial transcriptome thus served as a bioprobe of the MTB phagosomal environment, showing it to be nitrosative, oxidative, functionally hypoxic, carbohydrate poor, and capable of perturbing the pathogen's cell envelope.},

Examples for sphingolipid-dependent virus entry are found for: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which besides its protein receptors also interacts with glycosphingolipids (GSLs); rhinovirus, which promotes the formation of ceramide-enriched platforms and endocytosis; or measles virus (MV), which induces the surface expression of its own receptor CD150 via activation of sphingomyelinases (SMases). While SMase activation was implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) attachment, the virus utilizes the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C protein 1 (NPC1) as ‘intracellular’ entry receptor after uptake into endosomes. Differential activities of SMases also affect the intracellular milieu required for virus replication. Sindbis virus (SINV), for example, replicates better in cells lacking acid SMase (ASMase). Defined lipid compositions of viral assembly and budding sites influence virus release and infectivity, as found for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV. And finally, viruses manipulate cellular signaling and the sphingolipid metabolism to their advantage, as for example influenza A virus (IAV), which activates sphingosine kinase 1 and the transcription factor NF-κB.},

The LM cells endocytized the beads in direct proportion to the bead/cell ratio and the bead surface area. However, equal volumes of beads irrespective of size or surface area were internalized. The lipid composition of the phagosome membrane differed significantly from the parent primary membrane in having higher contents of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and sterot but lower contents of sphingomyelin and Iysophosphatidylcholine. When phagosomes isolated from suspension cultured LM fibroblasts were exposed to trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid at 4\textasciitilde{} 55• of the phagosomal membrane phosphatidylethanolamine was trinitrophenylated. The asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine across the phagosomal membrane was not affected by the bead/cell ratio, bead diameter, or exposure time of LM fibroblasts to the beads. When cells were reacted with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid at 4 \textasciitilde{} prior to phagocy-tosis, the amount of trinitrophenylphosphatidylethanolamine was greater in the isolated phagosomes than in the parent primary plasma membrane. Culturing LM fibroblasts in suspension or monolayer had no effect on the asymmetric distribution of phos-phatidylethanolamine across primary plasma membrane bilayers. The data are consistent with the observation that LM fibroblasts grown either in suspension or monolayer internalize polystyrene beads at selective sites in the surface membrane.},

Methods               This ongoing phase 3 study in ≥60-year-olds evaluates immune persistence until 3 years after RSVPreF3 OA vaccination. Here, we describe interim results on humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety until 1 year post–dose 1.                                         Results               In total, 1653 participants were vaccinated. One month post–dose 1, neutralization titers increased 10.5-fold (RSV-A) and 7.8-fold (RSV-B) vs pre–dose 1. Titers then declined to levels 4.4-fold (RSV-A) and 3.5-fold (RSV-B) above pre–dose 1 at month 6 and remained 3.1-fold (RSV-A) and 2.3-fold (RSV-B) above pre–dose 1 levels after 1 year. RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G levels and CD4+ T-cell frequencies showed similar kinetics. Solicited administration-site and systemic adverse events (mostly mild to moderate and transient) were reported by 62.2\% and 49.5\% of participants. Serious adverse events were reported by 3.9\% of participants within 6 months post–dose 1; 1 case was considered vaccine related.                                         Conclusions               One RSVPreF3 OA dose elicited cell-mediated and RSV-A– and RSV-B–specific humoral immune responses that declined over time but remained above pre–dose 1 levels for at least 1 year. The vaccine was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.               Clinical Trials Registration. NCT04732871 (ClinicalTrials.gov).},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that kills one person every 18 s. TB remains a global threat due to the emergence of drug-resistant \mkbibemph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb)} strains and the lack of an efficient vaccine. The ability of \mkbibemph{M.tb} to persist in latency, evade recognition following seroconversion, and establish resistance in vulnerable populations warrants closer examination. Past and current research has primarily focused on examination of the role of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells during \mkbibemph{M.tb} infection, which are critical in the establishment of the host response during infection. However, emerging evidence indicates that the alveolar epithelium is a harbor for \mkbibemph{M.tb} and critical during progression to active disease. Here we evaluate the relatively unexplored role of the alveolar epithelium as a reservoir and also its capacity to secrete soluble mediators upon \mkbibemph{M.tb }exposure, which influence the extent of infection. We further discuss how the \mkbibemph{M.tb-}alveolar epithelium interaction instigates cell-to-cell crosstalk that regulates the immune balance between a proinflammatory and an immunoregulatory state, thereby prohibiting or allowing the establishment of infection. We propose that consideration of alveolar epithelia provides a more comprehensive understanding of the lung environment in vivo in the context of host defense against \mkbibemph{M.tb.}},

  abstract = {Cellular membranes are composed of hundreds of different lipids, ion channels, receptors and scaffolding complexes that act as signalling and trafficking platforms for processes fundamental to life. Cellular signalling and membrane trafficking are often regulated by peripheral proteins, which reversibly interact with lipid molecules in highly regulated spatial and temporal fashions. In most cases, one or more modular lipid-binding domain(s) mediate recruitment of peripheral proteins to specific cellular membranes. These domains, of which more than 10 have been identified since 1989, harbour structurally selective lipid-binding sites. Traditional in vitro and in vivo studies have elucidated how these domains coordinate their cognate lipids and thus how the parent proteins associate with membranes. Cellular activities of peripheral proteins and subsequent physiological processes depend upon lipid binding affinities and selectivity. Thus, the development of novel sensitive and quantitative tools is essential in furthering our understanding of the function and regulation of these proteins. As this field expands into new areas such as computational biology, cellular lipid mapping, single molecule imaging, and lipidomics, there is an urgent need to integrate technologies to detail the molecular architecture and mechanisms of lipid signalling. This review surveys emerging cellular and in vitro approaches for studying protein-lipid interactions and provides perspective on how integration of methodologies directs the future development of the field.

Although mammals are typically used, we argue the validity of using insects as models in order to examine human diseases, particularly the growing number of opportunistic microorganisms. Insects can be used in large numbers, are easily manipulated, and are not subject to the same ethical concerns as mammalian systems. Insects and mammals have many parallels with respect to microbial pathogenesis, from proteinaceous integuments that require breaching before infection to similarities in their innate immune responses. Reactions of insects to Candida and Pseudomonas spp. infections show good correlation with mouse models, providing precedent-setting examples of the study of human pathogens using insects. Insects as pathogen hosts also warrant study because they may act as reservoirs for emerging human pathogens. Finally, insect models may be used to examine the evolutionary processes involved in the acquisition of virulence factors and host-jumping mechanisms indispensable to emerging pathogens. Insect models may be used in 'niche' investigations where large sample sizes can facilitate rapid, informative screening of opportunistic diseases and provide insights into pathogen evolution, while reducing the cost and ethical concerns associated with mammalian models. © 2006 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Using a novel steady-state antibiotic exposure system combined with chromosomal barcoding, we identified small hidden Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulations that repeatedly enter a state of drug tolerance with a predisposition to develop fixed drug resistance after first developing a cloud of unfixed resistance mutations.  Initial responses to tuberculosis treatment are poor predictors of final therapeutic outcomes in drug-susceptible disease, suggesting that treatment success depends on features that are hidden within a small minority of the overall infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis population. We developed a multitranswell robotic system to perform numerous parallel cultures of genetically barcoded M. tuberculosis exposed to steady-state concentrations of rifampicin to uncover these difficult-to-eliminate minority populations. We found that tolerance emerged repeatedly from at least two subpopulations of barcoded cells, namely, one that could not grow on solid agar media and a second that could form colonies, but whose kill curves diverged from the general bacterial population within 4 and 16 days of drug exposure, respectively. These tolerant subpopulations reproducibly passed through a phase characterized by multiple unfixed resistance mutations followed by emergent drug resistance in some cultures. Barcodes associated with drug resistance identified an especially privileged subpopulation that was rarely eliminated despite 20 days of drug treatment even in cultures that did not contain any drug-resistant mutants. The association of this evolutionary scenario with a defined subset of barcodes across multiple independent cultures suggested a transiently heritable phenotype, and indeed, glpK phase variation mutants were associated with up to 16\% of the resistant cultures. Drug tolerance and resistance were eliminated in a Δ ruvA mutant, consistent with the importance of bacterial stress responses. This work provides a window into the origin and dynamics of bacterial drug-tolerant subpopulations whose elimination may be critical for developing rapid and resistance-free cures.  IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis is unusual among bacterial diseases in that treatments which can rapidly resolve symptoms do not predictably lead to a durable cure unless treatment is continued for months after all clinical and microbiological signs of disease have been eradicated. Using a novel steady-state antibiotic exposure system combined with chromosomal barcoding, we identified small hidden Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulations that repeatedly enter a state of drug tolerance with a predisposition to develop fixed drug resistance after first developing a cloud of unfixed resistance mutations. The existence of these difficult-to-eradicate subpopulations may explain the need for extended treatment regimen for tuberculosis. Their identification provides opportunities to test genetic and therapeutic approaches that may result in shorter and more effective TB treatments.},

  abstract = {Mammalian phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) α and β, which share 77\% identity, have been shown to exhibit distinct lipid-transfer activities. In addition to transferring phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), PITPβ has been shown to transfer sphingomyelin (SM), and this has led to the suggestion that PITPβ is important for the regulation of SM metabolism. In the present study, we have analysed the ability of human PITPβ to transfer and regulate the metabolism of cellular SM. We report that, in vitro, the two PITP isoforms were comparable in mediating PI, PC or SM transfer. Using permeabilized HL-60 cells as the donor compartment, both PITP isoforms efficiently transferred PI and PC, and were slightly active towards SM, with the activity of PITPβ being slightly greater. To identify which cellular lipids were selected by PITPs, PITPα and PITPβ were exposed to permeabilized HL-60 cells, and subsequently repurified and analysed for their bound lipids. Both PITPs were able to select only PI and PC, but not SM. SM synthesis takes place at the Golgi, and PITPβ was shown to localize in that compartment. To examine the role of PITPβ in SM biosynthesis, Golgi membranes were used. Purified Golgi membranes had lost their endogenous PITPβ, but were able to recruit PITPβ when added exogenously. However, PITPβ did not enhance the activities of either SM synthase or glucosylceramide synthase. Further analysis in COS-7 cells overexpressing PITPβ showed no effects on (a) SM and glucosylceramide biosynthesis, (b) diacylglycerol or ceramide levels, (c) SM transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, or (d) resynthesis of SM after exogenous sphingomyelinase treatment. Altogether, these observations do not support the suggestion that PITPβ participates in the transfer of SM, the regulation of SM biosynthesis or its intracellular trafficking.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms that regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in cancer cells remain enigmatic. Recent data suggest that ceramide synthase1-6 (CerS1-6)-generated ceramides, containing different fatty acid chain lengths, might exhibit distinct and opposing functions, such as apoptosis versus survival in a context-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the activation of one of the major ER stress response proteins, ATF-6, and subsequent apoptosis by alterations of CerS6/C 16-ceramide. Induction of wild type (WT), but not the catalytically inactive mutant CerS6, increased tumor growth in SCID mice, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of CerS6 induced ATF-6 activation and apoptosis in multiple human cancer cells. Down-regulation of CerS6/C 16-ceramide, and not its further metabolism to glucosylceramide or sphingomyelin, activated ATF-6 upon treatment with ER stress inducers tunicamycin or SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid). Induction of WT-CerS6 expression, but not its mutant, or ectopic expression of the dominant-negative mutant form of ATF-6 protected cells from apoptosis in response to CerS6 knockdown and tunicamycin or SAHA treatment. Mechanistically, ATF-6 activation was regulated by a concerted two-step process involving the release of Ca 2+ from the ER stores ([Ca 2+ ]ER), which resulted in the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to CerS6/C 16-ceramide alteration. This resulted in the accumulation of pro-ATF-6 in the disrupted ER/Golgi membrane network, where pro-ATF6 is activated. Accordingly, ectopic expression of a Ca 2+ chelator calbindin prevented the Golgi fragmentation, ATF-6 activation, and apoptosis in response to CerS6/C 16-ceramide down-regulation. Overall, these data suggest a novel mechanism of how CerS6/C 16-ceramide alteration activates ATF6 and induces ER-stressmediated apoptosis in squamous cell carcinomas. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

To determine the accuracy and sensitivity of this assay, we compared the editing estimates derived by the T7E1 assay with that of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in pools of edited mammalian cells. Here, we report that estimates of nuclease activity determined by T7E1 most often do not accurately reflect the activity observed in edited cells. Editing efficiencies of CRISPR-Cas9 complexes with similar activity by T7E1 can prove dramatically different by NGS. Additionally, we compared editing efficiencies predicted by the Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) assay and the Indel Detection by Amplicon Analysis (IDAA) assay to that observed by targeted NGS for both cellular pools and single-cell derived clones. We show that targeted NGS, TIDE, and IDAA assays predict similar editing efficiencies for pools of cells but that TIDE and IDAA can miscall alleles in edited clones.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is an intracellular pathogen that can replicate within infected macrophages. The ability of M. tb to arrest phagosome maturation is believed to facilitate its intracellular multiplication. Rab GTPases regulate membrane trafficking, but details of how Rab GTPases regulate phagosome maturation and how M. tb modulates their localization during inhibiting phagolysosome biogenesis remain elusive. We compared the localization of 42 distinct Rab GTPases to phagosomes containing either Staphylococcus aureus or M. tb. The phagosomes containing S. aureus were associated with 22 Rab GTPases, but only 5 of these showed similar localization kinetics as the phagosomes containing M. tb. The Rab GTPases responsible for phagosome maturation, phagosomal acidification and recruitment of cathepsin D were examined in macrophages expressing the dominant-negative form of each Rab GTPase. LysoTracker staining and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Rab7, Rab20 and Rab39 regulated phagosomal acidification and Rab7, Rab20, Rab22b, Rab32, Rab34, Rab38 and Rab43 controlled the recruitment of cathepsin D to the phagosome. These results suggest that phagosome maturation is achieved by a series of interactions between Rab GTPases and phagosomes and that differential recruitment of these Rab GTPases, except for Rab22b and Rab43, to M. tb-containing phagosomes is involved in arresting phagosome maturation and inhibiting phagolysosome biogenesis. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

  abstract = {Ceramide lipids have emerged as important intracellular signalling molecules that mediate diverse cellular effects, of which programmed cell death, or apoptosis, has attracted significant interest. Although the exact mechanism(s) by which ceramides trigger apoptosis is not fully understood, there is considerable evidence that they are key mediators of this response. Exogenously applied, cell-permeable ceramides have been shown to induce apoptosis when incubated with cells in culture. We examined here the cytotoxicity of ceramides with varying acyl chain lengths in order to determine whether acyl chain length affects pro-apoptotic activity within the concentration range of 0-100 μM. We found that for C6-, C8-, C10-, C14- and C16-ceramide, the chain length was inversely proportional to cytotoxic activity, with C6-ceramide being most active (IC50 values in the 3-14 μM range) and C16-ceramide being least active (IC50 values in excess of 100 μM) in the MDA435/LCC6 human breast cancer and J774 mouse macrophage cell lines investigated. Using these two ceramide forms we were able to correlate the observed cytotoxicity with cellular uptake, and we observed that a lack of intracellular delivery may be responsible for the weak activity of C16-ceramide. We therefore investigated the possibility of incorporating ceramide lipids into liposome bilayers to enhance this delivery. We demonstrate that stable, ceramide-containing liposomes can be formulated, and that they are cytotoxic when taken up by cells in vitro. These results provide an increased understanding of the differences in cytotoxic activity of exogenous short- and long-chain ceramide lipids, and their incorporation into biologically active liposomal formulations opens new avenues for apoptosis induction. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Members of M. abscessus are a new “antibiotic nightmare” as one of the most resistant organisms to chemotherapeutic agents. Treatment of these infections is challenging due to the either intrinsic or acquired resistance of the M. abscessus complex to the available antibiotics. Recently, successful phage therapy with a cocktail of three phages (one natural lytic phage and two engineered phages) every 12 h for at least 32 weeks has been reported against a severe case of the disseminated M. abscessus subsp. massiliense infection, which underlines the high value of phages against drug-resistant superbugs. This report also highlighted the limitations of phage therapy, such as the absence of lytic phages with a broad host-range against all strains and subspecies of the M. abscessus complex and also the risk of phage resistant bacteria over treatment. Cutting-edge genomic technologies have facilitated the development of engineered phages for therapeutic purposes by introducing new desirable properties, changing host-range and arming the phages with additional killing genes. Here, we review the available literature and suggest new potential solutions based on the progress in phage engineering that can help to overcome the present limitations of M. abscessus treatment.},

Advantages of the QTrap included: greater sensitivity, similar ionization efficiencies for sphingolipids with ceramide versus dihydroceramide backbones, and the ability to identify the ceramide backbone of sphingomyelins using a pseudo-MS3 protocol. Compounds that can be readily quantified using an internal standard cocktail developed by the LIPID MAPS Consortium are: sphingoid bases and sphingoid base 1-phosphates, more complex species such as ceramides, ceramide 1-phosphates, sphingomyelins, mono- and di-hexosylceramides, and these complex sphingolipids with dihydroceramide backbones. With minor modifications, glucosylceramides and galactosylceramides can be distinguished, and more complex species such as sulfatides can also be quantified, when the internal standards are available. LC ESI-MS/MS can be utilized to quantify a large number of structural and signaling sphingolipids using commercially available internal standards. The application of these methods is illustrated with RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line. These methods should be useful for a wide range of focused (sphingo)lipidomic investigations.},

  abstract = {Signaling via the NF-kappaB cascade is critical for innate recognition of microbial products and immunity to infection. As a consequence, this pathway represents a strong selective pressure on infectious agents and many parasitic, bacterial and viral pathogens have evolved ways to subvert NF-kappaB signaling to promote their survival. Although the mechanisms utilized by microorganisms to modulate NF-kappaB signaling are diverse, a common theme is targeting of the steps that lead to IkappaB degradation, a major regulatory checkpoint of this pathway. The data presented here demonstrate that infection of mammalian cells with Toxoplasma gondii results in the activation of IKK and degradation of IkappaB. However, despite initiation of these hallmarks of NF-kappaB signaling, neither nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB nor NF-kappaB-driven gene expression is observed in infected cells. However, this defect was not due to a parasite-mediated block in nuclear import, as general nuclear import and constitutive nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kappaB remain intact in infected cells. Rather, in T. gondii-infected cells, the termination of NF-kappaB signaling is associated with reduced phosphorylation of p65/RelA, an event involved in the ability of NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA. Thus, these studies demonstrate for the first time that the phosphorylation of p65/RelA represents an event downstream of IkappaB degradation that may be targeted by pathogens to subvert NF-kappaB signaling.},

  abstract = {Sphingolipids are the major constituent of the mucus secreted by the cells of epithelial linings of lungs where they maintain the barrier functions and prevent microbial invasion. Sphingolipids are interconvertible, and their primary and secondary metabolites have both structural and functional roles. Out of several sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and ceramide are central molecules and decisive for sphingolipid signaling. These are produced by enzymatic activity of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK-1) upon the challenge with either biological or physiological stresses. S1P and ceramide rheostat are important for the progression of various pathologies, which are manifested by inflammatory cascade. S1P is a well-established secondary messenger and associated with various neuronal, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases other than respiratory infections such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These pathogens are known to exploit sphingolipid metabolism for their opportunistic survival. Decreased sphingosine kinase activity/S1P content in the lung and peripheral blood of tuberculosis patients clearly indicated a dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism during infection and suggest that sphingolipid metabolism is important for management of infection by the host. Our previous study has demonstrated that gain of SK-1 activity is important for the maturation of phagolysosomal compartment, innate activation of macrophages, and subsequent control of mycobacterial replication/growth in macrophages. Furthermore, S1P-mediated amelioration of lung pathology and disease severity in TB patients is believed to be mediated by the selective activation or rearrangement of various S1P receptors (S1PR) particularly S1PR2, which has been effective in controlling respiratory fungal pathogens. Therefore, such specificity of S1P-S1PR would be paramount for triggering inflammatory events, subsequent activation, and fostering bactericidal potential in macrophages for the control of TB. In this review, we have discussed and emphasized that sphingolipids may represent effective novel, yet dual specific drug targets for controlling pulmonary infections.},

  abstract = {Background: Diagnosis requires that clinicians communicate and share patient information in an efficient manner. Advances in electronic health records (EHR) and health information technologies have created both challenges and opportunities for such communication. Methods: We conducted a multi-method, focused ethnographic study of physicians on general medicine inpatient units in two teaching hospitals. Physician teams were observed during and after morning rounds to understand workflow, data sharing and communication during diagnosis. To validate findings, interviews and focus groups were conducted with physicians. Field notes and interview/focus group transcripts were reviewed and themes identified using content analysis. Results: Existing communication technologies and EHR-based data sharing processes were perceived as barriers to diagnosis. In particular, reliance on paging systems and lack of face-to- face communication among clinicians created obstacles to sustained thinking and discussion of diagnostic decision-making. Further, the EHR created data overload and data fragmentation, making integration for diagnosis difficult. To improve diagnosis, physicians recommended replacing pagers with two-way communication devices, restructuring the EHR to facilitate access to key information, and improving training on EHR systems. Conclusions: As advances in health information technology evolve, challenges in the way clinicians share information during the diagnostic process will rise. To improve diagnosis, changes to both the technology and the way in which we use it may be necessary.},

The enhanced expression of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids (GSLs) is a hallmark of many forms of renal disease including diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma. A common feature of each of these renal disorders is the preference metabolism via aerobic glycolysis. While aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate ATP, aerobic glycolysis promotes the formation of substrates important for the production of biomass, including lipids, amino acids and nucleotides, through the pentose phosphate pathway. Two products that are essential for the synthesis of glucosylceramide and more complex GSLs are generated through the pentose phosphate pathway. These products are reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH and UDP-glucose. In experimental models of each of these disorders, inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase with eliglustat or related analogues reverses the disease phenotype suggesting that blocking GSL synthesis should be explored as a potential treatment strategy.},

Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog β-D-N             4             -hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N             4             -hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields             in vitro             and             in vivo             were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability             in vivo             , all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.},

The mechanisms involved in the TLR-mediated cytokine response are well established; however, the possible contribution of TLR-dependent recognition of bacteria to macrophage phagocytosis remains unclear. Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular, parasitic, Gram-positive bacterium recognized mainly by TLR2. In this study, we investigated whether TLR2-dependent signaling is involved in the phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes by macrophages. We found no difference in the number of L. monocytogenes cells associating with wild-type (WT) and TLR2(-/-) macrophages 1 h after infection. However, the number of L. monocytogenes cells phagocytosed in TLR2(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) macrophages was significantly lower than that of WT macrophages. In addition, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment restored impaired phagocytic activity of TLR2(-/-) macrophages but did not enhance the activity of MyD88(-/-) macrophages. The efficiency of phagocytosis was suppressed by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the small Rho GTPases but not by cycloheximide. Moreover, functional activation of PI3K and Rac1 was impaired in TLR2(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) macrophages. In an in vivo infection model, we found significantly lower numbers of L. monocytogenes cells phagocytosed in peritoneal macrophages of TLR2(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) mice after intraperitoneal infection. Moreover, a lower number of bacteria were detected in the spleens of TLR2(-/-) mice 1 day after intravenous infection than in WT mice. These results clearly indicated that TLR2-MyD88-dependent signaling enhances the basal level of phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes by macrophages through activation of PI3K and Rac1, not by synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines or expression of phagocytic receptors.},

  abstract = {The protection against tuberculosis infection is largely determined by the ability of host tissue macrophages to limit the growth and spread of mycobacteria. Able to multiply within the host macrophages, mycobacteria have developed a number of protective mechanisms preventing phagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby evading damaging effects of lysosomal enzymes. Saposins are small, acidic, thermostable, non-enzymatic glycoproteins that participate as co-fac-tors in degradation of short oligosaccharide head group glycosphingolipids. Saposins A, B, C and D are formed in acidic endosomes due to cleavage of initial prosaposin molecule. The effect of saposins on human immune response is mediated by their involvement in presenting mycobacterial antigens on CD1 molecules. Preliminary studies with electron microscopy allowed to uncover saposin D-bound damaging effect on Mycobacterium tuberculosis in acidic environment. These data allowed us to suggest that saposin D is an important protective component fighting against TB infection. The aim of the study was to explore how saposin D deficiency might affect formation of anti-tuberculosis immune response and ability of macrophages to inhibit M. tuberculosis growth. Materials and methods. Interstitial pulmonary macrophages and peritoneal macrophages were isolated from wild type C57BL/6 strain and saposin D deficient C57BL/6-SapD-/- mouse strains. Results. It was found that as compared to macrophages from mice, macrophages from wild type strain significantly better controlled mycobacteria growth in vitro. To study an opportunity of compensating for deficient saposin D in peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6-SapD-/- mice, a saposin D gene-bearing lentiviral vector was created. Transfection of SAPD-deficient peritoneal macrophages with expression vector compensated for saposin D deficiency in such cells and restored bactericidal function. The mechanisms of action for current anti-TB drugs are mediated by various metabolic pathways in mycobacteria (inhibited biosynthesis of fatty acids, arabinogalactan, peptidoglycan and protein; inhibition of DNA-dependent processes, proton pumps and cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases). Conclusion. It was shown that saposin D deficiency affects activation of macrophage bactericidal function in vitro. Our study data may be a prerequisite for biologically substantiated potential of using a vector construct bearing natural human protein gene such as saposin D, as a new anti-tuberculosis drug.},

  abstract = {A description of the pathophysiology of aspergillosis is followed by a review of investigational considerations of animal models. Because a large body of invasive Aspergillus infection occurs as opportunistic infection, there is a large spectrum of the histopathological feature of lesions demonstrated at the site of infection. Histopathology of the lesions can be understood as a phenotypical representation of interaction between lowered defense mechanisms in the host and the virulence of invading fungi. Detailed observations with a consideration of previous pathological knowledge of infection and inflammation provide much important information useful in predicting the pathophysiology of the patient. Moreover, experimental studies can also provide much insight to elucidate pathogenesis of the infection that emerges from the clinical and pathological investigations. The importance of pathophysiology should be emphasized to understand the implications of radiographic images, clinical symptoms, and laboratory dates. By reviewing these, especially computed tomography (CT) images, we can see that they accurately mirror the histological features of the lesion that can be recognized as a phenotypical representation of pathophysiology of Aspergillus infection. This is also confirmed by the reports emphasizing the importance of CT scans to identify hallmark clinical signs and symptoms of the disease.},

  abstract = {Introduction Host lipids play important roles in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis. Whether host lipids at TB treatment initiation (baseline) affect subsequent treatment outcomes has not been well characterised. We used unbiased lipidomics to study the prospective association of host lipids with TB treatment failure. Methods A case–control study (n=192), nested within a prospective cohort study, was used to investigate the association of baseline plasma lipids with TB treatment failure among adults with pulmonary TB. Cases (n=46) were defined as TB treatment failure, while controls (n=146) were those without failure. Complex lipids and inflammatory lipid mediators were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry techniques. Adjusted least-square regression was used to assess differences in groups. In addition, machine learning identified lipids with highest area under the curve (AUC) to classify cases and controls. Results Baseline levels of 32 lipids differed between controls and those with treatment failure after false discovery rate adjustment. Treatment failure was associated with lower baseline levels of cholesteryl esters and oxylipin, and higher baseline levels of ceramides and triglycerides compared to controls. Two cholesteryl ester lipids combined in a unique classifier model provided an AUC of 0.79 (95\% CI 0.65–0.93) in the test dataset for prediction of TB treatment failure. Conclusions We identified lipids, some with known roles in TB pathogenesis, associated with TB treatment failure. In addition, a lipid signature with prognostic accuracy for TB treatment failure was identified. These lipids could be potential targets for risk-stratification, adjunct therapy and treatment monitoring.},

  abstract = {The cestode Hymenolepis diminuta (Cyclophyllidea) uses a variety of insects as its intermediate host, where ingestion of eggs results in development in the hemocoel of a cysticercoid that is infective to a rat definitive host. Species in 2 genera, Tenebrio and Tribolium (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) have been used extensively as laboratory intermediate hosts. This review examines experimental studies on ecological aspects of the relationship between H. diminuta and tenebrionid beetles, including the acquisition and establishment of the parasite, host effects on the parasite, and parasite effects on the host. A meta-analysis of infection results from the literature revealed strong relationships across host species and strains between (1) prevalence and intensity of infection, (2) efficiency of cysticercoid production and exposure conditions, and (3) variance in abundance or intensity of infection relative to their respective means. The underlying mechanisms producing these patterns remain elusive. Comparative studies are infrequent, and the use of divergent methodologies hampers comparisons among studies. In spite of these problems, there is much to recommend this as a terrestrial host-parasite model system. It represents those relationships in which mostly minor, but occasionally major, responses to parasitic infection occur, and in which host genetics and environmental conditions can serve as modifying factors. Moreover, this is a tractable experimental system, and is backed by an extensive literature on host biology.},

The profile, which comprised 546 proteins, suggests diverse functions of the phagosome and potential connections to secretory processes, toll-like receptor signaling, and autophagy. Many identified proteins were not previously known to reside in the phagosome. We characterized several proteins in LBC phagosomes that change in abundance on induction of autophagy, a process that has been previously implicated in the host defense against microbial pathogens. These observations suggest crosstalk between autophagy and phagocytosis that may be relevant to the innate immune response of macrophages. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

While Mtb determinants, such as the ESX-1 type VII secretion system, that contribute to this phenomenon are known, the host cell factors governing this important biological process are yet unexplored. Using a newly developed flow-cytometric approach for Mtb, we show that macrophages expressing the phagosomal bivalent cation transporter Nramp-1, are much less susceptible to phagosomal rupture. Together with results from the use of the phagosome acidification inhibitor bafilomycin, we demonstrate that restriction of phagosomal acidification is a prerequisite for mycobacterial phagosomal rupture and cytosolic contact. Using different in vivo approaches including an enrichment and screen for tracking rare infected phagocytes carrying the CD45.1 hematopoietic allelic marker, we here provide first and unique evidence of M. tuberculosis-mediated phagosomal rupture in mouse spleen and lungs and in numerous phagocyte types. Our results, linking the ability of restriction of phagosome acidification to cytosolic access, provide an important conceptual advance for our knowledge on host processes targeted by Mtb evasion strategies.},

  abstract = {Survival within macrophages is a central feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. Despite significant advances in identifying new immunological parameters associated with mycobacterial disease, some basic questions on the intracellular fate of the causative agent of human tuberculosis in antigen-presenting cells are still under debate. To get novel insights into this matter, we used a single-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to investigate the potential cytosolic access of M. tuberculosis and the resulting cellular consequences in an unbiased, quantitative way. Analysis of thousands of THP-1 macrophages infected with selected wild-type or mutant strains of the M. tuberculosis complex unambiguously showed that M. tuberculosis induced a change in the FRET signal after 3 to 4 days of infection, indicating phagolysosomal rupture and cytosolic access. These effects were not seen for the strains M. tuberculosisΔRD1 or BCG, both lacking the ESX-1 secreted protein ESAT-6, which reportedly shows membrane-lysing properties. Complementation of these strains with the ESX-1 secretion system of M. tuberculosis restored the ability to cause phagolysosomal rupture. In addition, control experiments with the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum showed phagolysosomal translocation only for ESX-1 intact strains, further validating our experimental approach. Most importantly, for M. tuberculosis as well as for M. marinum we observed that phagolysosomal rupture was followed by necrotic cell death of the infected macrophages, whereas ESX-1 deletion- or truncation-mutants that remained enclosed within phagolysosomal compartments did not induce such cytotoxicity. Hence, we provide a novel mechanism how ESX-1 competent, virulent M. tuberculosis and M. marinum strains induce host cell death and thereby escape innate host defenses and favor their spread to new cells. In this respect, our results also open new research directions in relation with the extracellular localization of M. tuberculosis inside necrotic lesions that can now be tackled from a completely new perspective.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis               under stress stores triacylglycerol (TG). There are 15 genes in               M. tuberculosis               that belong to a novel family of TG synthase genes (               tgs               ), but it is not known which of them is responsible for this accumulation of TG. In this paper, it is reported that               M. tuberculosis               H37Rv accumulated TG under acidic, static or hypoxic growth conditions, or upon treatment with NO, whereas TG accumulation was drastically reduced in the               tgs1               (Rv3130c) disrupted mutant.

C               26               was a major fatty acid in this TG, indicating that the TGS1 gene product uses C               26               fatty acid, which is known to be produced by the mycobacterial fatty acid synthase.

  abstract = {Abstract             Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes several mechanisms to block phagosome–lysosome fusion to evade host cell restriction. However, induction of host cell autophagy by starvation was shown to overcome this block, resulting in enhanced lysosomal delivery to mycobacterial phagosomes and the killing of the M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv. Nevertheless, our previous studies found that strains belonging to the M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype can resist starvation-induced autophagic elimination, though the mycobacterial factors involved remain unclear. In this study, we showed that KatG expression is upregulated in the autophagy-resistant M. tuberculosis Beijing strain (BJN) during autophagy induction by the starvation of host macrophages, while such increase was not observed in the H37Rv. KatG depletion using the CRISPR-dCas9 interference system in the BJN resulted in increased lysosomal delivery to its phagosome and decreased its survival upon autophagy induction by starvation. As KatG functions by catabolizing ROS, we determined the source of ROS contributing to the starvation-induced autophagic elimination of mycobacteria. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we found that Superoxide dismutase 2, which generates mitochondrial ROS but not NADPH oxidase 2, is important for the starvation-induced lysosomal delivery to mycobacterial phagosomes. Taken together, these findings showed that KatG is vital for the BJN to evade starvation-induced autophagic restriction.},

  abstract = {For polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to orient migration to chemotactic gradients, weak external asymmetries must be amplified into larger internal signaling gradients. Lipid mediators, associated with the plasma membrane and within the cell, participate in generating these gradients. This study examined the role in PMN chemotaxis of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), a plasma membrane-associated enzyme that converts sphingomyelin to ceramide. A noncompetitive N-SMase inhibitor, GW4869 (5 mM, 5 minutes), did not inhibit PMN motility (as percentage of motile cells, or mean cell velocity), but it abrogated any orientation of movement toward the source of the chemotaxin, formylmethionylleucylphenylanaline (FMLP) (net displacement along the gradient axis in micrometers, or as percentage of total migration distance). This defect could be completely reversed by treatment with lignoceric ceramide (5 μg/ml, 15 minutes). Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that N-SMase (1) distributes preferentially toward the leading edge of some elongated cells, (2) is associated with the plasma membrane, (3) is more than 99.5\% localized to the cytofacial aspect of the plasma membrane, (4) is excluded from pseudopodial extensions, and (5) increases rapidly in response to FMLP. Morphologically, the inhibition of N-SMase limited cellular spreading and the extension of sheet-like pseudopods. Elongated PMNs demonstrated a polarized distribution of GTPases, with Rac 1/2 accumulated at, and RhoA excluded from, the front of the cell. This polarity was negated by N-SMase inhibition and restored by lignoceric ceramide. We conclude that N-SMase at the cytofacial plasma membrane is an essential element for the proper orientation of PMNs in FMLP gradients, at least in part by polarizing the distribution of Rac 1/2 and RhoA GTPases.},

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is a dominant sphingolipid in membranes of mammalian cells and this lipid class is specifically enriched in the plasma membrane, the endocytic recycling compartment, and the trans Golgi network. The distribution of SM and cholesterol among cellular compartments correlate. Sphingolipids have extensive hydrogen-bonding capabilities which together with their saturated nature facilitate the formation of sphingolipid and SM-enriched lateral domains in membranes. Cholesterol prefers to interact with SMs and this interaction has many important functional consequences. In this review, the synthesis, regulation, and intracellular distribution of SMs are discussed. The many direct roles played by membrane SM in various cellular functions and processes will also be discussed. These include involvement in the regulation of endocytosis and receptor-mediated ligand uptake, in ion channel and G-protein coupled receptor function, in protein sorting, and functioning as receptor molecules for various bacterial toxins, and for non-bacterial pore-forming toxins. SM is also an important constituent of the eye lens membrane, and is believed to participate in the regulation of various nuclear functions. SM is an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and new studies have shed light on possible mechanism behind its role in atherogenesis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Virulent               M. marinum               is able to escape from the               Mycobacterium               -containing vacuole (MCV) into the host cell cytosol, polymerize actin, and spread from cell to cell. In this study, we have examined nine               M. marinum               ESX-1 mutants and the wild type by using fluorescence and electron microscopy detecting MCV membranes and actin polymerization. We conclude that ESX-1 plays an essential role in               M. marinum               escape from the MCV. We also show that the ESX-1 mutants acquire the ability to polymerize actin after being artificially delivered into the macrophage cytosol by hypotonic shock treatment, indicating that ESX-1 is not directly involved in initiation of actin polymerization. We provide evidence that               M. marinum               induces membrane pores ∼4.5 nm in diameter, and this activity correlates with ESAT-6 secretion. Importantly, purified ESAT-6, but not the other ESX-1-secreted proteins, is able to cause dose-dependent pore formation in host cell membranes. These results suggest that ESAT-6 secreted by               M. marinum               ESX-1 could play a direct role in producing pores in MCV membranes, facilitating               M. marinum               escape from the vacuole and cell-to-cell spread. Our study provides new insight into the mechanism by which ESX-1 secretion and ESAT-6 enhance the virulence of mycobacterial infection.},

  abstract = {The rate of active tuberculosis (TB) on the lands known as Canada is 1 of the lowest in the world. As “a social disease with a medical dimension,” it is well-recognized that success in eliminating TB is dependent not only upon medical treatment but upon addressing and remedying social inequalities and addressing these social determinants of health. Of the 1,796 cases of active TB reported in Canada in 2017, 72\% were in people born outside of Canada and 17\% were in Indigenous people. The disparities in the distribution of TB that these rates reveal must be understood in terms of structural conditions and social determinants of health, including poverty, inadequate housing and overcrowding, food insecurity, and access to health care. Stigma, as a social determinant of health, is of particular focus within TB policy and care. Underpinning TB elimination strategies in Canada is the expressed need to “[e]nd the stigma and discrimination associated with TB – the underlying social, cultural, and historical factors that lead to shame and silence around TB.” Viewing TB stigma as a social determinant of health highlights how TB stigma is “inextricably linked to an individual’s social positioning.” Within Canada, TB mostly afflicts Indigenous peoples and migrants. This highlights how other structural dimensions that shape social positioning — including colonialism, racism, and migration — are affected by and influence TB stigma. The thrust of the attention on stigma around TB is that the shame associated with TB, and the fear of being isolated, is a barrier to the uptake of screening and treatment programs. The concept of health-related stigma and its intersection with other forms of identity-based discrimination are explored further in the 2019 annual report on the state of public health in Canada. Here, in the opening address, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam, describes how: Stigma and discrimination towards persons with health conditions, such as mental illness, substance use disorders, and HIV, cannot be understood or treated separately from stigma related to other characteristics such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and income. These many forms of stigma, that intersect in complex ways, are very much present in our health system, driving those most in need from getting effective care and accessing services. It means that we, as health system leaders and practitioners, are contributing to negative health outcomes.(p. 5) A recent CADTH Policy Insights identified the importance of colonialism and stigma as affecting adherence to latent TB infection treatment. Stigma, which resulted in avoiding contact with health care systems and providers due to fear, was seen as part of Canada’s legacy of colonial TB policy toward Indigenous peoples, particularly in the North. From the 1940s to 1960s, Canada’s TB policy was to remove Indigenous children and adults from the north for treatment in sanatoria in the south. Many died and were never heard from again, with families still searching for their loved one’s graves. In 2019, the federal government issued an apology to the Inuit for these policies and practices, acknowledging them as colonial and as a destructive force in the lives of individuals, families, and communities, and as leaving a lasting impact to this day. For newcomers to Canada, the process of settlement is known to be highly disruptive and stressful. Migrants disproportionately work for low wages and in precarious jobs, and face additional challenges finding adequate housing — all of this in addition to language barriers and the process of acculturation. The socioeconomic position of migrants is attributable to the reactivation of latent TB infections. This CADTH Rapid Response aims to describe the ways that stigma interacts in relation to structural racism, colonialism, and migration that are particularly relevant to addressing TB in Canada. This specific focus aims not to diminish or negate other forms of discrimination and structural or social relations of power. Our aim is to further a broader understanding of how these particular forms of discrimination and systemic inequalities are shaped by and, in turn, shape stigma in TB policy and care.},

Through studies that began by investigating this rare disease, recent findings have uncovered the important role of this enzyme in the initiation of ceramide-mediated signal transduction. This unique function involves translocation of the enzyme from intracellular compartments to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, where hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide initiates membrane reorganization and facilitates the formation and coalescence of lipid microdomains. These microdomains are sites of protein-protein interactions that lead to downstream signaling, and perturbation of microdomain formation influences the pathophysiology of many common diseases. The initial observations implicating ASM in this process have come from studies using cells from patients with NPD or from ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice, where the genetic deficiency of this enzymatic activity has been shown to protect these cells and animals from stress-induced and developmental apoptosis. This review will discuss the complex biology of this enzyme in the context of these new findings and its recently reported importance in common human diseases, including cancer, sepsis, cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver, and neurological diseases as well as the potential for using ASM (or ASM inhibitors) as therapeutic agents.},

Its production in the               trans-               Golgi traps cholesterol synthesized in the ER to promote formation of a sphingomyelin/sterol gradient along the secretory pathway. This gradient marks a fundamental transition in physical membrane properties that help specify organelle identify and function. We previously identified mutations in sphingomyelin synthase SMS2 that cause osteoporosis and skeletal dysplasia. Here, we show that SMS2 variants linked to the most severe bone phenotypes retain full enzymatic activity but fail to leave the ER owing to a defective autonomous ER export signal. Cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate sphingomyelin in the ER and display a disrupted transbilayer sphingomyelin asymmetry. These aberrant sphingomyelin distributions also occur in patient-derived fibroblasts and are accompanied by imbalances in cholesterol organization, glycerophospholipid profiles, and lipid order in the secretory pathway. We postulate that pathogenic SMS2 variants undermine the capacity of osteogenic cells to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions that are critical for their bone forming activity.},

  abstract = {Annual influenza outbreaks are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the availability of seasonal vaccines. Influenza pathogenesis depends on the manipulation of host cell signaling to promote virus replication. Ceramide is a sphingosine-derived lipid that regulates diverse cellular processes. Studies highlighted the differential role of ceramide de novo biosynthesis on the propagation of various viruses. Whether ceramide plays, a role in influenza virus replication is not known. In this study, we assessed the potential interplay between the influenza A (IAV) and ceramide biosynthesis pathways. The accumulation of ceramide in human lung epithelial cells infected with influenza A/H1N1 virus strains was evaluated using thin-layer chromatography and/or confocal microscopy. Virus replication was assessed upon the regulation of the de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway. A significant increase in ceramide accumulation was observed in cells infected with IAV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inoculating the cells with UV-inactivated IAV did not result in ceramide accumulation in the cells, suggesting that the induction of ceramide required an active virus replication. Inhibiting de novo ceramide significantly decreased ceramide accumulation and enhanced virus replication. The addition of exogenous C 6 -ceramide prior to infection mediated an increase in cellular ceramide levels and significantly attenuated IAV replication and reduced viral titers (≈1 log10 PFU/ml unit). Therefore, our data demonstrate that ceramide accumulation through de novo biosynthesis pathway plays a protective and antiviral role against IAV infection. These findings propose new avenues for development of antiviral molecules and strategies.},

  abstract = {Neutrophils exposed to chemoattractants polarize and accumulate polymerized actin at the leading edge. In neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, this asymmetry depends on a positive feedback loop in which accumulation of a membrane lipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI[3,4,5]P3), leads to activation of Rac and/or Cdc42, and vice versa. We now report that Rac and Cdc42 play distinct roles in regulating this asymmetry. In the absence of chemoattractant, expression of constitutively active Rac stimulates accumulation at the plasma membrane of actin polymers and of GFP-tagged fluorescent probes for PI(3,4,5)P3 (the PH domain of Akt) and activated Rac (the p21-binding domain of p21-activated kinase). Dominant negative Rac inhibits chemoattractant-stimulated accumulation of actin polymers and membrane translocation of both fluorescent probes and attainment of morphologic polarity. Expression of constitutively active Cdc42 or of two different protein inhibitors of Cdc42 fails to mimic effects of the Rac mutants on actin or PI(3,4,5)P3. Instead, Cdc42 inhibitors prevent cells from maintaining a persistent leading edge and frequently induce formation of multiple, short lived leading edges containing actin polymers, PI(3,4,5)P3, and activated Rac. We conclude that Rac plays a dominant role in the PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent positive feedback loop required for forming a leading edge, whereas location and stability of the leading edge are regulated by Cdc42.},

Stapels               et al.               found that these cells are not dormant but are actively modulating their environment.               Salmonella               within their host macrophage niche deployed a specialized type 3 secretory system called SPI-2 to deliver virulence factors, including SteE, into host cells. SteE changed the cytokine profile of the infected macrophages to reprogram them into a noninflammatory and infection-permissive state. Thus, when antibiotics were removed, the               Salmonella               could reemerge and cause disease.

In vitro, persister cells appear to be dormant. After uptake of               Salmonella               species by macrophages, nongrowing persisters also occur, but their physiological state is poorly understood. In this work, we show that               Salmonella               persisters arising during macrophage infection maintain a metabolically active state. Persisters reprogram macrophages by means of effectors secreted by the               Salmonella               pathogenicity island 2 type 3 secretion system. These effectors dampened proinflammatory innate immune responses and induced anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Such reprogramming allowed nongrowing               Salmonella               cells to survive for extended periods in their host. Persisters undermining host immune defenses might confer an advantage to the pathogen during relapse once antibiotic pressure is relieved.},

  abstract = {The genetic and biochemical mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis senses and responds to the complex environment that it encounters during infection and persistence within the host remain unknown. In a number of bacterial species, the Kdp signal transduction pathway appears to be the primary response to environmental osmotic stress, which is primarily mediated by K+ concentration in bacteria. We show that kdp encodes for components of a mycobacterial signalling pathway by demonstrating the K+ dependence of kdpFABC expression in both M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium smegmatis. To identify proteins of M. tuberculosis that participate in this signalling pathway, we used the N-terminal sensing module of the histidine kinase KdpD as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We show that the sensing domain of KdpD interacts specifically with two membrane lipoproteins, LprJ (Rv1690) and LprF (Rv1368). Overexpression of lprF and lprJ alleles in mycobacterial kdpF-lacZ reporter strains enabled us to identify alleles that modulate kdpFABC expression. By exploiting the yeast three-hybrid system, we have found that the histidine kinase domain of KdpD forms ternary complexes with LprF and LprJ and the sensing module of KdpD. Our results establish a role for membrane proteins in the Kdp signalling pathway and suggest that LprF and LprJ function as accessory or ligand-binding proteins that communicate directly with the sensing domain of KdpD to modulate kdp expression.},

  abstract = {Prior to statistical analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) data, quality control (QC) of the identified biomolecule peak intensities is imperative for reducing process-based sources of variation and extreme biological outliers. Without this step, statistical results can be biased. Additionally, liquid chromatography-MS proteomics data present inherent challenges due to large amounts of missing data that require special consideration during statistical analysis. While a number of R packages exist to address these challenges individually, there is no single R package that addresses all of them. We present pmartR, an open-source R package, for QC (filtering and normalization), exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical analysis robust to missing data. Example analysis using proteomics data from a mouse study comparing smoke exposure to control demonstrates the core functionality of the package and highlights the capabilities for handling missing data. In particular, using a combined quantitative and qualitative statistical test, 19 proteins whose statistical significance would have been missed by a quantitative test alone were identified. The pmartR package provides a single software tool for QC, EDA, and statistical comparisons of MS data that is robust to missing data and includes numerous visualization capabilities.},

  abstract = {The apicomplexan moving junction (MJ) is a highly conserved structure formed during host cell entry that anchors the invading parasite to the host cell and serves as a molecular sieve of host membrane proteins that protects the parasitophorous vacuole from host lysosomal destruction. While recent work in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium has reinforced the composition of the MJ as an important association of rhoptry neck proteins (RONs) with micronemal AMA1, little is known of the precise role of RONs in the junction or how they are targeted to the neck subcompartment. We report the first functional analysis of a MJ/RON protein by disrupting RON8 in T. gondii. Parasites lacking RON8 are severely impaired in both attachment and invasion, indicating that RON8 enables the parasite to establish a firm clasp on the host cell and commit to invasion. The remaining junction components frequently drag in trails behind invading knockout parasites and illustrate a malformed complex without RON8. Complementation of Δron8 parasites restores invasion and reveals a processing event at the RON8 C-terminus. Replacement of an N-terminal region of RON8 with a mCherry reporter separates regions within RON8 that are necessary for rhoptry targeting and complex formation from those required for function during invasion. Finally, the invasion defects in Δron8 parasites seen in vitro translate to radically impaired virulence in infected mice, promoting a model in which RON8 has a crucial and unprecedented task in committing Toxoplasma to host cell entry.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans by cells of the innate immune system is vital to prevent infection. Dectin-1 is the major phagocytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity. We identify two new interacting proteins of Dectin-1 in macrophages, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1. BTK and Vav1 are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae but are absent from mature phagosomes. BTK and Vav1 localize to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. BTK and Vav1 colocalize with the lipid PI(3,4,5)P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, we show that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lack BTK or Vav1 show reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild type mice. This work identifies an important role for BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C. albicans. © 2013 Strijbis et al.},

  abstract = {Silencing those genes that are overexpressed in cancer and contribute to the survival and progression of tumour cells is the aim of several researches. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the most intensively studied genes since it is overexpressed in most tumours, mainly in colon cancer. The use of specific COX-2 inhibitors to treat colon cancer has generated great enthusiasm. Yet, the side effects of some inhibitors emerging during long-term treatment have caused much concern. Genes silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) has led to new directions in the field of experimental oncology. In this study, we detected sequences directed against COX-2 mRNA, that potently downregulate COX-2 gene expression and inhibit phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced angiogenesis in vitro in a specific, nontoxic manner. Moreover, we found that the insertion of a specific cassette carrying anti-COX-2 short hairpin RNA sequence into a viral vector (pSUPER.retro) greatly increased silencing potency in a colon cancer cell line (HT29) without activating any interferon response. Phenotypically, COX-2 deficient HT29 cells showed a significant impairment of their in vitro malignant behaviour. Thus, the retroviral approach enhancing COX-2 knockdown, mediated by RNAi, proved to be an useful tool to better understand the role of COX-2 in colon cancer. Furthermore, the higher infection efficiency we observed in tumour cells, if compared to normal endothelial cells, may disclose the possibility to specifically treat tumour cells without impairing endothelial COX-2 activity. © 2006 Cancer Research.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is a significant global infectious disease caused by infection of the lungs with               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               , which resides and replicates mainly within host phagocytic cells. During coevolution with humans, Mtb has acquired various mechanisms to inhibit host cellular processes, including autophagy.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Autophagy is an ubiquitous homeostatic pathway in mammalian cells and plays a significant role in host immunity. Substantial evidence indicates that the ability of               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               (Mtb) to successfully evade immune responses is partially due to inhibition of autophagic pathways. Our previous screening of Mtb transposon mutants identified the PPE51 protein as an important autophagy-inhibiting effector. We found that expression of PPE51, either by infecting bacteria or by direct expression in host cells, suppressed responses to potent autophagy-inducing stimuli and interfered with bacterial phagocytosis. This phenotype was associated with reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a key component of signaling pathways that stimulate autophagy. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrated that the effects of PPE51 are attributable to signal blocking by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a receptor with known involvement of activation of ERK1/2 and autophagy. Consistent with these results, mice with intact TLR2 signaling showed striking virulence attenuation for an Mtb               ppe51               deletion mutant (Δ               51               ) compared to wild-type Mtb, whereas infection of TLR2-deficient mice showed no such attenuation. Mice infected with Δ               51               also displayed increased T cell responses to Mtb antigens and increased autophagy in infected lung tissues. Together, these results suggest that TLR2 activates relevant host immune functions during mycobacterial infection, which Mtb then evades through suppression of TLR2 signaling by PPE51. In addition to its previously identified function transporting substrates across the bacterial cell wall, our results demonstrate a direct role of PPE51 for evasion of both innate and adaptive immunity to Mtb.                                         IMPORTANCE               Tuberculosis is a significant global infectious disease caused by infection of the lungs with               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               , which resides and replicates mainly within host phagocytic cells. During coevolution with humans, Mtb has acquired various mechanisms to inhibit host cellular processes, including autophagy. Autophagy is a complex host cellular process that helps control intracellular infections by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses. We identified the Mtb protein PPE51 as a mycobacterial effector that inhibits autophagy. We discovered TLR2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling as the axis by which PPE51 mediates this effect. Autophagy regulation by PPE51, along with suppression of other TLR2-activated host cell functions, leads to increased bacterial survival in phagocytic cells and tissues of infected mice. A better understanding of how Mtb regulates autophagy and other host immune effectors could facilitate the design of new therapeutics or vaccines against tuberculosis.},

This disease group includes tuberculosis, leprosy (Hansen’s disease), Buruli Ulcer, and non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease. The burden of NTM disease, both pulmonary and ulcerative, is drastically escalating globally, especially in developed countries such as America and Australia. Mycobacteria’s ability to inhibit or evade the host immune system has contributed significantly to its continued prevalence. Pre-clinical studies have highlighted promising candidates that enhance endogenous pathways and/or limit destructive host responses. Autophagy is a cell-autonomous host defense mechanism by which intracytoplasmic cargos can be delivered and then destroyed in lysosomes. Previous studies have reported that autophagy-activating agents, small molecules, and autophagy-activating vaccines may be beneficial in restricting intracellular mycobacterial infection, even with multidrug-resistant strains. This review will examine how mycobacteria evade autophagy and discusses how autophagy could be exploited to design novel TB treatment strategies, such as host-directed therapeutics and vaccines, against               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               and NTMs.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis requires receptor-mediated recognition of particles, usually in the guise of infectious agents and apoptotic cells. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes to generate phagolysosomes, which play a key role in enzymatic digestion of the internalized contents into component parts. Recent findings indicate that a simple paradigm of a single cognate receptor interaction that guides the phagosome to phagolysosome formation belies the complexity of combinatorial receptor recognition and diversity of phagosome function. In fact, phagosomes are comprised of hundreds of proteins that play a key role in deciphering the contents of the phagosome and in defining host response. In this review we discuss how the challenge of recognizing diverse molecular patterns is met by combinatorial interactions between phagocytic receptors. Furthermore, these combinations are dynamic and both sculpt the balance between a proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory response and direct phagosome diversity. We also indicate an important role for genetically tractable model organisms in defining key components of this evolutionarily conserved process.},

We propose that SPH helps maintain the integrity of the plasma membrane by protecting phosphatidylcholine (PC) against oxidative damage and phospholipase degradation. Since it contains mostly saturated longchain hydrocarbon groups, we postulate that SPH impedes the lateral propagation of the lipid peroxides by decreasing membrane fluidity, while also acting as an 'insulating' molecule. By virtue of its structural similarity to PC, it acts as a competitive inhibitor of the phospholipases, which may otherwise hydrolyze PC excessively. Because phospholipase reaction is the rate-limiting step in eicosanoid synthesis, SPH may serve as an endogenous anti-inflammatory molecule. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

  abstract = {Ceramide is a product of agonist-induced sphingolipid metabolism in several cell types, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). In adherent PMNs, the kinetics of ceramide production correspond with the termination of fMLP-stimulated H 2 O 2 release. Furthermore, short chain ceramides inhibit fMLP-mediated H 2 O 2 release in adherent PMNs. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short chain ceramides and sphingoid bases on phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (EIgG) by suspended PMNs activated with fMLP. N-Acetylsphingosine, N- acetylphytosphingosine, phytosphingosine, sphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine, but not N-acetyldihydrosphingosine, inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG. In contrast, these same lipids did not inhibit fMLP- mediated chemotaxis. Endogenous ceramide levels increased within the first few minutes of phagocytosis, with a significant (P {$<$} .05) accumulation by 30 minutes, the time by which phagocytosis was terminated. Neutral sphingomyelinase activity paralleled the increase in ceramide, consistent with the generation of ceramide by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. The N- acetyl-conjugated sphingols (C 2 ceramides) blocked phosphatidylethanol formation indicating that phospholipase D (PLD) is an intracellular target of ceramide action. These data suggest that ceramides, generated through activation of the sphingomyelin cycle, act as negative regulators of FcγR- mediated phagocytosis.},

  abstract = {In an adaptive immune response, naive T cells proliferate during infection and generate long-lived memory cells that undergo secondary expansion after a repeat encounter with the same pathogen. Although natural killer (NK) cells have traditionally been classified as cells of the innate immune system, they share many similarities with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We use a mouse model of cytomegalovirus infection to show that, like T cells, NK cells bearing the virus-specific Ly49H receptor proliferate 100-fold in the spleen and 1,000-fold in the liver after infection. After a contraction phase, Ly49H-positive NK cells reside in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs for several months. These self-renewing 'memory' NK cells rapidly degranulate and produce cytokines on reactivation. Adoptive transfer of these NK cells into naive animals followed by viral challenge results in a robust secondary expansion and protective immunity. These findings reveal properties of NK cells that were previously attributed only to cells of the adaptive immune system.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to explore underlying mechanisms by which sphingolipid-related genes play a role in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and construct a new prognosis-related risk model. We used a variety of bioinformatics methods and databases to complete our exploration. Based on the TCGA database, we used multiple R-based extension packages for data transformation, processing, and statistical analyses. First, on analyzing the CNV, SNV, and mRNA expression of 29 sphingolipid-related genes in various types of cancers, we found that the vast majority were protective in KIRC. Subsequently, we performed cluster analysis of patients with KIRC using sphingolipid-related genes and successfully classified them into the following three clusters with significant prognostic differences: Cluster 1, Cluster 2, and Cluster 3. We performed differential analyses of transcription factor activity, drug sensitivity, immune cell infiltration, and classical oncogenes to elucidate the unique roles of sphingolipid-related genes in cancer, especially KIRC, and provide a reference for clinical treatment. After analyzing the risk rates of sphingolipid-related genes in KIRC, we successfully established a risk model composed of seven genes using LASSO regression analysis, including SPHK1, CERS5, PLPP1, SGMS1, SGMS2, SERINC1, and KDSR. Previous studies have suggested that these genes play important biological roles in sphingolipid metabolism. ROC curve analysis results showed that the risk model provided good prediction accuracy. Based on this risk model, we successfully classified patients with KIRC into high- and low-risk groups with significant prognostic differences. In addition, we performed correlation analyses combined with clinicopathological data and found a significant correlation between the risk model and patient’s M, T, stage, grade, and fustat. Finally, we developed a nomogram that predicted the 5-, 7-, and 10-year survival in patients with KIRC. The model we constructed had strong predictive ability. In conclusion, we believe that this study provides valuable data and clues for future studies on sphingolipid-related genes in KIRC.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the etiologic agent responsible for COVID-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.},

  abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a leading contributor to mortality during recent influenza pandemics. The mechanism for this influenza-induced susceptibility to secondary S. aureus infection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that innate antibacterial immunity was significantly suppressed during the recovery stage of influenza infection, even though MRSA superinfection had no significant effect on viral burdens. Compared with mice infected with bacteria alone, postinfluenza MRSA-infected mice exhibited impaired bacterial clearance, which was not due to defective phagocyte recruitment, but rather coincided with reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. NADPH oxidase is responsible for reactive oxygen species production during phagocytic bacterial killing, a process also known as oxidative burst. We found that gp91(phox)-containing NADPH oxidase activity in macrophages and neutrophils was essential for optimal bacterial clearance during respiratory MRSA infections. In contrast to wild-type animals, gp91(phox-/-) mice exhibited similar defects in MRSA clearance before and after influenza infection. Using gp91(phox+/-) mosaic mice, we further demonstrate that influenza infection inhibits a cell-intrinsic contribution of NADPH oxidase to phagocyte bactericidal activity. Taken together, our results establish that influenza infection suppresses NADPH oxidase-dependent bacterial clearance and leads to susceptibility to secondary MRSA infection.},

However, the functional consequences of such clustering has been unclear. We biochemically reconstituted a 12-component signaling pathway on model membranes, beginning with T cell receptor (TCR) activation and ending with actin assembly. When TCR phosphorylation was triggered, downstream signaling proteins spontaneously separated into liquid-like clusters that promoted signaling outputs both in vitro and in human Jurkat T cells. Reconstituted clusters were enriched in kinases but excluded phosphatases and enhanced actin filament assembly by recruiting and organizing actin regulators. These results demonstrate that protein phase separation can create a distinct physical and biochemical compartment that facilitates signaling.},

  abstract = {Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles that compartmentalize the glycolytic enzymes in kinetoplastid parasites. These organelles are developmentally regulated in their number and composition, allowing metabolic adaptation to the parasite’s needs in the blood of mammalian hosts or within their arthropod vector. A protein phosphatase cascade regulates differentiation between parasite developmental forms, comprising a tyrosine phosphatase, Trypanosoma brucei PTP1 (TbPTP1), which dephosphorylates and inhibits a serine threonine phosphatase, TbPIP39, which promotes differentiation. When TbPTP1 is inactivated, TbPIP39 is activated and during differentiation becomes located in glycosomes. Here we have tracked TbPIP39 recruitment to glycosomes during differentiation from bloodstream “stumpy” forms to procyclic forms. Detailed microscopy and live-cell imaging during the synchronous transition between life cycle stages revealed that in stumpy forms, TbPIP39 is located at a periflagellar pocket site closely associated with TbVAP, which defines the flagellar pocket endoplasmic reticulum. TbPTP1 is also located at the same site in stumpy forms, as is REG9.1, a regulator of stumpy-enriched mRNAs. This site provides a molecular node for the interaction between TbPTP1 and TbPIP39. Within 30 min of the initiation of differentiation, TbPIP39 relocates to glycosomes, whereas TbPTP1 disperses to the cytosol. Overall, the study identifies a “stumpy regulatory nexus” (STuRN) that coordinates the molecular components of life cycle signaling and glycosomal development during transmission of Trypanosoma brucei .},

The monocyte/macro-phage-like cell line RAW 264.7 has been one of the most commonly used myeloid cell line for more than 40 years. Despite its phenotypic and functional stability is often discussed in literature or at various scientific discussion panels, their stability during the consecutive passages has not been confirmed in any solid study. So far, only a few functional features of these cells have been studied, for example their ability to differentiate into osteoclasts. Therefore, in the present paper we have investigated the phenotype and functional stability of the RAW 264.7 cell line from passage no. 5 till passage no. 50.

  abstract = {Sphingomyelin (SM) is a vital component of cellular membranes in organisms ranging from mammals to protozoa. Its production involves the transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, yielding diacylglycerol in the process. The mammalian genome encodes two known SM synthase (SMS) isoforms, SMS1 and SMS2. However, the relative contributions of these enzymes to SM production in mammalian cells remained to be established. Here we show that SMS1 and SMS2 are co-expressed in a variety of cell types and function as the key Golgi- and plasma membrane-associated SM synthases in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, respectively. RNA interference-mediated depletion of either SMS1 or SMS2 caused a substantial decrease in SM production levels, an accumulation of ceramides, and a block in cell growth. Although SMS-depleted cells displayed a reduced SM content, external addition of SM did not restore growth. These results indicate that the biological role of SM synthases goes beyond formation of SM. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The ability of phagocytes to clear pathogens is an essential attribute of the innate immune response. The role of signaling lipid molecules such as phosphoinositides is well established, but the role of membrane sphingolipids in phagocytosis is largely unknown. Using a genetic approach and small molecule inhibitors, we show that phagocytosis of Candida albicans requires an intact sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. Blockade of serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and ceramide synthase-enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis- by myriocin and fumonisin B1, respectively, impaired phagocytosis by phagocytes. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate Sptlc2-deficient DC2.4 dendritic cells, which lack serine palmitoyl transferase activity. Sptlc2-/- DC2.4 cells exhibited a stark defect in phagocytosis, were unable to bind fungal particles and failed to form a normal phagocytic cup to engulf C. albicans. Supplementing the growth media with GM1, the major ganglioside present at the cell surface, restored phagocytic activity of Sptlc2-/- DC2.4 cells. While overall membrane trafficking and endocytic pathways remained functional, Sptlc2-/- DC2.4 cells express reduced levels of the pattern recognition receptors Dectin-1 and TLR2 at the cell surface. Consistent with the in vitro data, compromised sphingolipid biosynthesis in mice sensitizes the animal to C. albicans infection. Sphingolipid biosynthesis is therefore critical for phagocytosis and in vivo clearance of C. albicans.},

The transport of HA to the cell surface was assessed by accessibility of HA on intact cells to exogenously added trypsin and to HA-specific antibodies. Rates of de novo synthesis of viral proteins in wild-type and SGMS1-deficient cells were equivalent, and HA negotiated the intracellular trafficking pathway through the Golgi normally. We engineered a strain of influenza virus to allow site-specific labeling of HA and NA using sortase. Accessibility of both HA and NA to sortase was blocked in SGMS1-deficient cells and in cells exposed to myriocin, with a corresponding inhibition of the release of virus particles from infected cells. Generation of influenza virus particles thus critically relies on a functional sphingomyelin biosynthetic pathway, required to drive influenza viral glycoproteins into lipid domains of a composition compatible with virus budding and release.},

As ceramides are engaged in apoptotic pathways, cells would need to monitor their levels closely to avoid killing themselves during sphingolipid biosynthesis. How this is accomplished remains to be established. Here we identify SMSr (SAMD8), an ER-resident ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase, as a suppressor of ceramide-mediated cell death. Disruption of SMSr catalytic activity causes a rise in ER ceramides and their mislocalization to mitochondria, triggering a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Blocking de novo ceramide synthesis, stimulating ceramide export from the ER or targeting a bacterial ceramidase to mitochondria rescues SMSr-deficient cells from apoptosis. We also show that SMSr-catalyzed CPE production, although essential, is not sufficient to suppress ceramide-induced cell death and that SMSr-mediated ceramide homeostasis requires the N-terminal sterile a-motif, or SAM domain, of the enzyme. These results define ER ceramides as bona fide transducers of mitochondrial apoptosis and indicate a primary role of SMSr in monitoring ER ceramide levels to prevent inappropriate cell death during sphingolipid biosynthesis. © 2014.

  abstract = {Programmed cell death is an important physiological response to many forms of cellular stress. The signaling cascades that result in programmed cell death are as elaborate as those that promote cell survival, and it is clear that coordination of both protein- and lipid-mediated signals is crucial for proper cell execution. Sphingolipids are a large class of lipids whose diverse members share the common feature of a long-chain sphingoid base, e.g., sphingosine. Many sphingolipids have been shown to play essential roles in both death signaling and survival. Ceramide, an N-acylsphingosine, has been implicated in cell death following a myriad of cellular stresses. Sphingosine itself can induce cell death but via pathways both similar and dissimilar to those of ceramide. Sphingosine-1-phosphate, on the other hand, is an anti-apoptotic molecule that mediates a host of cellular effects antagonistic to those of its pro-apoptotic sphingolipid siblings. Extraordinarily, these lipid mediators are metabolically juxtaposed, suggesting that the regulation of their metabolism is of the utmost importance in determining cell fate. In this review, we briefly examine the role of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate in programmed cell death and highlight the potential roles that these lipids play in the pathway to apoptosis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, these interactions are poorly understood, at least at the molecular level. Here we show that M. tuberculosis enters human monocyte-derived DCs after binding to the recently identified lectin DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). By contrast, complement receptor (CR)3 and mannose receptor (MR), which are the main M. tuberculosis receptors on macrophages (Mϕs), appeared to play a minor role, if any, in mycobacterial binding to DCs. The mycobacteria-specific lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was identified as a key ligand of DC-SIGN. Freshly isolated human LDCs were found to express DC-SIGN, and M. tuberculosis–derived material was detected in CD14−HLA-DR+DC-SIGN+ cells in lymph nodes (LNs) from patients with tuberculosis. Thus, as for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is captured by the same receptor, DC-SIGN–mediated entry of M. tuberculosis in DCs in vivo is likely to influence bacterial persistence and host immunity.},

Earlier studies showed that plasma membrane repair requires Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes and a rapid form of endocytosis that removes membrane lesions. However, the functional relationship between lysosomal exocytosis and the rapid endocytosis that follows membrane injury is unknown. In this study, we show that the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is released extracellularly when cells are wounded in the presence of Ca2+. ASM-deficient cells, including human cells from Niemann-Pick type A (NPA) patients, undergo lysosomal exocytosis after wounding but are defective in injury-dependent endocytosis and plasma membrane repair. Exogenously added recombinant human ASM restores endocytosis and resealing in ASM-depleted cells, suggesting that conversion of plasma membrane sphingomyelin to ceramide by this lysosomal enzyme promotes lesion internalization. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism for restoration of plasma membrane integrity through exocytosis of lysosomes and identify defective plasma membrane repair as a possible component of the severe pathology observed in NPA patients.},

However, the mechanism through which sphingolipids control aging has long been a mystery. Emerging studies reveal that sphingolipids exert tight control over lysosomal homeostasis and function, as evidenced by sphingolipid-related diseases, including but not limited to lysosomal storage disorders. These diseases are defined by primary lysosomal defects and a few secondary defects such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Intriguingly, recent research indicates that the majority of these defects are also associated with aging, implying that sphingolipid-related diseases and aging may share common mechanisms. We propose that the lysosome is a pivotal hub for sphingolipid-mediated aging regulation. This review discusses the critical roles of sphingolipid metabolism in regulating various lysosomal functions, with an emphasis on how such regulation may contribute to aging and aging-related diseases.},

Several host factors are involved in producing tolerance, while others are responsible for killing the mycobacterium. Tryptophan aspartate-containing coat protein (TACO; also known as CORO1A or coronin-1) inhibits the phagosome maturation that allows intracellular parasitization. In addition, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) activates the innate immune response. Both CORO1A and TLR-2 co-localize on the phagosomal membrane in the dermal lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy. Therefore, we hypothesized that CORO1A and TLR-2 might interact functionally. This hypothesis was tested by investigating the effect of CORO1A in TLR-2-mediated signalling and, inversely, the effect of TLR-2-mediated signalling on CORO1A expression. We found that CORO1A suppresses TLR-mediated signal activation in human macrophages, and that TLR2-mediated activation of the innate immune response resulted in suppression of CORO1A expression. However, M. leprae infection inhibited the TLR-2-mediated CORO1A suppression and nuclear factor-kappaB activation. These results suggest that the balance between TLR-2-mediated signalling and CORO1A expression will be key in determining the fate of M. leprae following infection.},

However, the molecular mechanism of ASM–ceramide-mediated apoptosis during IL-2 deprivation is poorly understood. Here, we showed that IL-2 deprivation induces caspase-dependent apoptosis characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-8, -9, and -3 cleavage, and degradation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). IL-2 re-supplementation rescued apoptosis via inhibition of XIAP degradation without affecting caspase cleavage. However, IL-2 deprivation induced ceramide elevation via ASM in lysosomes and activated lysosomal cathepsin B (CTSB) but not cathepsin D. A CTSB inhibitor CA-074 Me and knockdown of CTSB inhibited ceramide-mediated XIAP degradation and apoptosis. Inhibition of ceramide accumulation in lysosomes using an ASM inhibitor, desipramine, decreased cytosolic activation of CTSB by inhibiting its transfer into cytosol from the lysosome. Knockdown of ASM also inhibited XIAP degradation and apoptosis. Furthermore, cell permeable               N               -acetyl sphingosine (C               2               -ceramide), which increases mainly endogenous d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/24:1 ceramide-like IL-2 deprivation, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis with XIAP degradation through CTSB. These findings suggest that lysosomal ceramide produced by ASM mediates XIAP degradation by activation of cytosolic CTSB and caspase-dependent apoptosis. The ASM–ceramide–CTSB signaling axis is a novel pathway of ceramide-mediated apoptosis in IL-2-deprived NK/T lymphoma cells.},

  abstract = {The role of "sphingolipid rheostat" by ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in the regulation of autophagy remains unclear. In human leukemia HL-60 cells, amino acid deprivation (AA(-)) caused autophagy with an increase in acid sphingomyleinase (SMase) activity and ceramide, which serves as an autophagy inducing lipid. Knockdown of acid SMase significantly suppressed the autophagy induction. S1P treatment counteracted autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. AA(-) treatment promoted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dephosphorylation/inactivation, inducing autophagy. S1P treatment suppressed mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-). S1P exerts biological actions via cell surface receptors, and S1P(3) among five S1P receptors was predominantly expressed in HL-60 cells. We evaluated the involvement of S1P(3) in suppressing autophagy induction. S1P treatment of CHO cells had no effects on mTOR inactivation and autophagy induction by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. Whereas S1P treatment of S1P(3) overexpressing CHO cells resulted in activation of the mTOR pathway, preventing cells from undergoing autophagy induced by AA(-) or C(2)-ceramide. These results indicate that S1P-S1P(3) plays a role in counteracting ceramide signals that mediate mTOR-controlled autophagy. In addition, we evaluated the involvement of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases (CAPPs) in ceramide-dependent inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Inhibition of CAPP by okadaic acid in AA(-)- or C(2)-ceramide-treated cells suppressed dephosphorylation/inactivation of mTOR, autophagy induction, and autophagy-associated cell death, indicating a novel role of ceramide-CAPPs in autophagy induction. Moreover, S1P(3) engagement by S1P counteracted cell death. Taken together, these results indicated that sphingolipid rheostat in ceramide-CAPPs and S1P-S1P(3) signaling modulates autophagy and its associated cell death through regulation of the mTOR pathway.},

SMS deficiency significantly reduced both intracellular and extracellular JEV levels at 48 h after infection. Furthermore, after 15 min treatment with JEV, the early steps of JEV infection such as attachment and cell entry were also diminished in SMS-deficient tMEFs. The inhibition of JEV attachment and infection were recovered by overexpression of SMS1 but not SMS2, suggesting SMS1 contributes to SM production for JEV attachment and infection. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of JEV into SMS1-deficient mice showed an obvious decrease of JEV infection and its associated pathologies, such as meningitis, lymphocyte infiltration, and elevation of interleukin 6, compared with wild type mice.

Although cholesterol has been shown to participate in both the entry and replication steps of JEV, the mechanisms of infection, including the cellular receptors of JEV, remain largely unknown. To clarify the infection mechanisms of JEV, we generated pseudotype (JEVpv) and recombinant (JEVrv) vesicular stomatitis viruses bearing the JEV envelope protein. Both JEVpv and JEVrv exhibited high infectivity for the target cells, and JEVrv was able to propagate and form foci as did authentic JEV. Anti-JEV envelope antibodies neutralized infection of the viruses. Treatment of cells with inhibitors for vacuolar ATPase and clathrin-mediated endocytosis reduced the infectivity of JEVpv, suggesting that JEVpv enters cells via pH- and clathrin-dependent endocytic pathways. Although treatment of the particles of JEVpv, JEVrv, and JEV with cholesterol drastically reduced the infectivity as previously reported, depletion of cholesterol from the particles by treatment with methyl β-cyclodextrin enhanced infectivity. Furthermore, treatment of cells with sphingomyelinase (SMase), which hydrolyzes membrane-bound sphingomyelin to ceramide, drastically enhanced infection with JEVpv and propagation of JEVrv, and these enhancements were inhibited by treatment with an SMase inhibitor or C 6 -ceramide. These results suggest that ceramide plays crucial roles in not only entry but also egress processes of JEV, and they should assist in the clarification of JEV propagation and the development of novel therapeutics against diseases caused by infection with flaviviruses.},

  abstract = {Lysosomal dysfunction has been increasingly linked to disease and normal ageing1,2. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), a hallmark of lysosome-related diseases, can be triggered by diverse cellular stressors3. Given the damaging contents of lysosomes, LMP must be rapidly resolved, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we show that LMP stimulates a phosphoinositide-initiated membrane tethering and lipid transport (PITT) pathway for rapid lysosomal repair. Upon LMP, phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase type 2α (PI4K2A) accumulates rapidly on damaged lysosomes, generating high levels of the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Lysosomal phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in turn recruits multiple oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein (ORP) family members, including ORP9, ORP10, ORP11 and OSBP, to orchestrate extensive new membrane contact sites between damaged lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. The ORPs subsequently catalyse robust endoplasmic reticulum-to-lysosome transfer of phosphatidylserine and cholesterol to support rapid lysosomal repair. Finally, the lipid transfer protein ATG2 is also recruited to damaged lysosomes where its activity is potently stimulated by phosphatidylserine. Independent of macroautophagy, ATG2 mediates rapid membrane repair through direct lysosomal lipid transfer. Together, our findings identify that the PITT pathway maintains lysosomal membrane integrity, with important implications for numerous age-related diseases characterized by impaired lysosomal function.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). In this study, we present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes reinforcing feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We decomposed the effective model into three modules; a signal initiation module that sensed and transformed an ATRA signal into program activation signals; a signal integration module that controlled the expression of upstream transcription factors; and a phenotype module which encoded the expression of functional differentiation markers from the ATRA-inducible transcription factors. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. Additionally, the model captured intermediate and phenotypic gene expression data. Knockout analysis suggested Gfi-1 and PPARg were critical to the ATRAinduced differentiation program. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggested that reinforcing feedback is central to hyperactive signaling in a diversity of cell fate programs.},

  abstract = {Shortly after the cellular mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) was first described, scientists began using this powerful technique to study gene function. This included designing better methods for the successful delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into mammalian cells. While the simplest method for RNAi is the cytosolic delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides, this technique is limited to cells capable of transfection and is primarily utilized during transient in vitro studies. The introduction of shRNA into mammalian cells through infection with viral vectors allows for stable integration of shRNA and long-term knockdown of the targeted gene; however, several challenges exist with the implementation of this technology. Here we describe some well-tested protocols which should increase the chances of successful design, delivery, and assessment of gene knockdown by shRNA. We provide suggestions for designing shRNA targets and controls, a protocol for sequencing through the secondary structure of the shRNA hairpin structure, and protocols for packaging and delivery of shRNA lentiviral particles. Using real-time PCR and functional assays we demonstrate the successful knockdown of ASC, an inflammatory adaptor molecule. These studies demonstrate the practicality of including two shRNAs with different efficacies of knockdown to provide an additional level of control and to verify dose dependency of functional effects. Along with the methods described here, as new techniques and algorithms are designed in the future, shRNA is likely to include further promising application and continue to be a critical component of gene discovery.},

Using a novel mAb (2A11) raised against betaGR, we show here that the receptor is not dendritic cell-restricted as first reported, but is broadly expressed, with highest surface expression on populations of myeloid cells (monocyte/macrophage (Mphi) and neutrophil lineages). Dendritic cells and a subpopulation of T cells also expressed the betaGR, but at lower levels. Alveolar Mphi, like inflammatory Mphi, exhibited the highest surface expression of betaGR, indicative of a role for this receptor in immune surveillance. In contrast, resident peritoneal Mphi expressed much lower levels of betaGR on the cell surface. Characterization of the nonopsonic recognition of zymosan by resident peritoneal Mphi suggested the existence of an additional beta-glucan-independent mechanism of zymosan binding that was not observed on elicited or bone marrow-derived Mphi. Although this recognition could be inhibited by mannan, we were able to exclude involvement of the Mphi mannose receptor and complement receptor 3 in this process. These observations imply the existence of an additional mannan-dependent receptor involved in the recognition of zymosan by resident peritoneal Mphi.},

  abstract = {Microbial lung infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the hereditary metabolic disorder cystic fibrosis, yet the molecular mechanisms leading from the mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to lung infection are still unclear. Here, we show that ceramide age-dependently accumulates in the respiratory tract of uninfected Cftr-deficient mice owing to an alkalinization of intracellular vesicles in Cftr-deficient cells. This change in pH results in an imbalance between acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) cleavage of sphingomyelin to ceramide and acid ceramidase consumption of ceramide, resulting in the higher levels of ceramide. The accumulation of ceramide causes Cftr-deficient mice to suffer from constitutive age-dependent pulmonary inflammation, death of respiratory epithelial cells, deposits of DNA in bronchi and high susceptibility to severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Partial genetic deficiency of Asm in Cftr -/-Smpd1+/- mice or pharmacological treatment of Cftr-deficient mice with the Asm blocker amitriptyline normalizes pulmonary ceramide and prevents all pathological findings, including susceptibility to infection. These data suggest inhibition of Asm as a new treatment strategy for cystic fibrosis. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here, using genetic and chemical tools to probe functions of the S1P(1) receptor, we elucidate cellular and signaling mechanisms that are important in initiating cytokine storm. Whereas S1P(1) receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue, S1P(1) agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild-type and lymphocyte-deficient mice, identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm. Furthermore, our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events that are both orchestrated by endothelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P(1) signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus. Modulation of endothelium with a specific agonist suggests that diseases in which amplification of cytokine storm is a significant pathological component could be chemically tractable.},

Various bacteria, which are responsible for deadly diseases including tuberculosis and salmonellosis, are capable of hijacking this important immune cell type and thrive intracellularly, either in the cytoplasm or in specialized vacuoles. Tight regulation of cellular metabolism is critical in shaping the macrophage polarization states and immune functions. Lipids, besides being the bulk component of biological membranes, serve as energy sources as well as signaling molecules during infection and inflammation. With the advent of systems-scale analyses of genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites, in combination with classical biology, it is increasingly evident that macrophages undergo extensive lipid remodeling during activation and infection. Each bacterium species has evolved its own tactics to manipulate host metabolism towards its own advantage. Furthermore, modulation of host lipid metabolism affects disease susceptibility and outcome of infections, highlighting the critical roles of lipids in infectious diseases. Here, we will review the emerging roles of lipids in the complex host-pathogen relationship and discuss recent methodologies employed to probe these versatile metabolites during the infection process. An improved understanding of the lipid-centric nature of infections can lead to the identification of the Achilles’ heel of the pathogens and host-directed targets for therapeutic interventions. Currently, lipid-moderating drugs are clinically available for a range of non-communicable diseases, which we anticipate can potentially be tapped into for various infections.},

In contrast, little is known of the lipid composition of the inner leaflet of raft, where many acylated signal-transducing molecules, such as trimeric G proteins and protein tyrosine kinases, associate. NAP-22 is a neuronal protein localized on the inner leaflet of raft domain. This protein was found to bind cholesterol in the liposome. In this study, we further analyze the lipid binding activity of NAP-22 using eukaryotic and bacterial expression systems. In addition to cholesterol, NAP-22 showed a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)- and polyphosphoinositide-dependent membrane binding in the liposome assay. The N-terminal myristoylation was essential for the liposome binding. The C-terminal deletion up to D61 showed little effect on the binding. The lipid binding region was hence judged to be in the N-terminal 60-amino-acid sequence. NAP-22 was then expressed in COS7 cells, and the intracellular localization was studied. Biochemical analysis showed the localization of NAP-22 in a Triton-insoluble low-density fraction. Cell staining analysis showed colocalization patterns of NAP-22 with PE and cholesterol in the membrane. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In a bioinformatics approach, we now identified a new family of protein sequences from animals, plants, and fungi and characterized these sequences biochemically by expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This resulted in the identification of the enzyme sphingolipid A4-desaturase (dihydroceramide desaturase) from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Candida albicans, in addition to a bifunctional sphingolipid A4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase from M. musculus. Among the sequences investigated are the Homo sapiens membrane lipid desaturase, the M. musculus degenerative spermatocyte, and the Drosophila melanogaster degenerative spermatocyte proteins. During spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis of des mutant flies, both cell cycle and spermatid differentiation are specifically blocked at the entry into the first meiotic division, leading to male sterility. This mutant phenotype can be restored to wild-type by complementation with a functional copy of the des gene (Endo, K., Akiyama, T., Kobayashi S., and Okada, M. (1996) MoL Gen. Genet. 253, 157-165). These results suggest that A4-desaturated sphingolipids provide an early signal necessary to trigger the entry into both meiotic and spermatid differentiation pathways during Drosophila spermatogenesis.},

Here, we show that AP-3 and AP-1 function independently in sorting of the melanocyte-specific protein tyrosinase from endosomes to the melanosome, a specialized lysosome-related organelle distinguishable from lysosomes. AP-3 and AP-1 localize in melanocytes primarily to clathrin-coated buds on tubular early endosomes near melanosomes. Both adaptors recognize the tyrosinase dileucine-based melanosome sorting signal, and tyrosinase largely colocalizes with each adaptor on endosomes. In AP-3-deficient melanocytes, tyrosinase accumulates inappropriately in vacuolar and multivesicular endosomes. Nevertheless, a substantial fraction still accumulates on melanosomes, concomitant with increased association with endosomal AP-1. Our data indicate that AP-3 and AP-1 function in partially redundant pathways to transfer tyrosinase from distinct endosomal subdomains to melanosomes and that the AP-3 pathway ensures that tyrosinase averts entrapment on internal membranes of forming multivesicular bodies.},

The pathogenesis of tuberculosis involves inhibition of phagosome maturation, leading to survival of M.tb within human macrophages. A key determinant is M.tb-induced inhibition of macrophage sphingosine kinase (SK) activity, which normally induces Ca2+ signaling and phagosome maturation. Our objective was to determine the spatial localization of SK during phagocytosis and its inhibition by M.tb. Stimulation of SK activity by killed M.tb, live Staphylococcus aureus, or latex beads was associated with translocation of cytosolic SK1 to the phagosome membrane. In contrast, SK1 did not associate with phagosomes containing live M.tb. To characterize the mechanism of phagosomal translocation, live cell confocal microscopy was used to compare the localization of wild-type SK1, catalytically inactive SK1G82D, and a phosphorylation-defective mutant that does not undergo plasma membrane translocation (SK1S225A). The magnitude and kinetics of translocation of SK1G82D and SK1S225A to latex bead phagosomes were indistinguishable from those of wild-type SK1, indicating that novel determinants regulate the association of SK1 with nascent phagosomes. These data are consistent with a model in which M.tb inhibits both the activation and phagosomal translocation of SK1 to block the localized Ca2+ transients required for phagosome maturation.},

  abstract = {Background: The prognosis, specifically the case fatality and duration, of untreated tuberculosis is important as many patients are not correctly diagnosed and therefore receive inadequate or no treatment. Furthermore, duration and case fatality of tuberculosis are key parameters in interpreting epidemiological data. Methodology and Principal Findings: To estimate the duration and case fatality of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV negative patients we reviewed studies from the pre-chemotherapy era. Untreated smear-positive tuberculosis among HIV negative individuals has a 10-year case fatality variously reported between 53\% and 86\%, with a weighted mean of 70\%. Ten-year case fatality of culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis was nowhere reported directly but can be indirectly estimated to be approximately 20\%. The duration of tuberculosis from onset to cure or death is approximately 3 years and appears to be similar for smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis. Conclusions: Current models of untreated tuberculosis that assume a total duration of 2 years until self-cure or death underestimate the duration of disease by about one year, but their case fatality estimates of 70\% for smear-positive and 20\% for culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis appear to be satisfactory. © 2011 Tiemersma et al.},

We present an extensive and systematic profiling of lipids, metabolites, and proteins in respiratory compartments of ferrets infected with either 1918 or 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. Integrative analysis of high-throughput omics data with virologic and histopathologic data uncovered relationships between host responses and phenotypic outcomes of viral infection. Proinflammatory lipid precursors in the trachea following 1918 infection correlated with severe tracheal lesions. Using an algorithm to infer cell quantity changes from gene expression data, we found enrichment of distinct T~cell subpopulations in the trachea. There was also a predicted increase in inflammatory monocytes in the lung of 1918 virus-infected animals that was sustained throughout infection. This study presents a unique resource to the influenza research community and demonstrates the utility of an integrative systems approach for characterization of lipid metabolism alterations underlying respiratory responses to viruses.},

  abstract = {Phagocytosis is a major mechanism by which the mediators of innate immunity thwart microbial infections. Here we demonstrate that human herpesviruses may have evolved a common mechanism to exploit a phagocytosis-like entrapment to gain entry into ocular cells. While herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) causes corneal keratitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is associated with retinitis in immunocompromised individuals. A third herpesvirus, human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is crucial for the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a common AIDS-related tumor of eyelid and conjunctiva. Using laser scanning confocal microscopy, we show that successful infection of ocular cell types by all the three viruses, belonging to three divergent subfamilies of herpesviruses, is facilitated by induction of F-actin rich membrane protrusions. Inhibitors of F-actin polymerization and membrane protrusion formation, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B, were able to block infection by all three viruses. Similar inhibition was seen by blocking phosphoinositide 3 kinase signaling, which is required for microbial phagocytosis. Transmission electron microscopy data using human corneal fibroblasts for HSV-1, human retinal pigment epithelial cells for CMV, and human conjunctival epithelial cells for HHV-8 are consistent with the possibility that pseudopod-like membrane protrusions facilitate virus uptake by the ocular cells. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the nonprofessional mediators of phagocytosis can be infected by human herpesviruses.},

  abstract = {Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite that causes sleeping sickness. In mammalian hosts, trypanosomes are thought to exist in two major niches: early in infection, they populate the blood; later, they breach the blood-brain barrier. Working with a well-established mouse model, we discovered that adipose tissue constitutes a third major reservoir for T. brucei. Parasites from adipose tissue, here termed adipose tissue forms (ATFs), can replicate and were capable of infecting a naive animal. ATFs were transcriptionally distinct from bloodstream forms, and the genes upregulated included putative fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. Consistent with this, ATFs were able to utilize exogenous myristate and form β-oxidation intermediates, suggesting that ATF parasites can use fatty acids as an external carbon source. These findings identify the adipose tissue as a niche for T. brucei during its mammalian life cycle and could potentially explain the weight loss associated with sleeping sickness.},

However, the neurobiology underlying the association between sleep and adolescent behavior remains elusive. In the current study, we examine how poor sleep quality relates to cognitive control and reward related brain function during risk taking. Forty-six adolescents participated in a functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) scan during which they completed a cognitive control and risk taking task. Behaviorally, adolescents who reported poorer sleep also exhibited greater risk-taking. This association was paralleled by less recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during cognitive control, greater insula activation during reward processing, and reduced functional coupling between the DLPFC and affective regions including the insula and ventral striatum during reward processing. Collectively, these results suggest that poor sleep may exaggerate the normative imbalance between affective and cognitive control systems, leading to greater risk-taking in adolescents.},

Only 2.5 cm of the column were used for high resolution separations. A specially designed removable top cone permitted precise gradient introduction, thin sample layering (0.3-1 mm) and precise fractionation after electrophoresis. A bottom circular palladium anode (nongassing) was separated hydrodynamically but not electrically from the density gradient by a cation-permeable membrane. A top circular platinum cathode caused negatively charged particles to migrate upwards (levitation). Thin sample layering permitted short separation times (30-60 min) at only 3 V/cm (10 mA). As for proteins, glycoforms of a1-antitrypsin were separated as well as isoenzymes of beta-hexoseaminidase. Furthermore, separation of transferrin (Tf) from the putative Tf-receptor complex was effectuated. The device was equally suitable for the separation of Megadalton proteins (mucins). Artificial mixtures of intact erythrocytes (rat, rabbit, human) were separated with high resolution. About 10(7) cells (of 100 microns3 cell volume) could be loaded onto the device. Crude microsomes from the human melanoma cell line Mel JuSo were separated after brief trypsin treatment within 38 min at 10 mA. Ratios of the migration velocities of the constituent organelles were: late endosomes (LE):lysosomes (L):Golgi (G):early endosomes (EE) = 1:0.94:0.77:0.55 and under slightly different conditions LE:L:G:endoplasmatic reticulum (ER):plasma membrane (PM) = 1:0.87:0.64:0.58:0.49.}

  abstract = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the main cause of adult blindness, is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptors through apoptosis. Up to now, 39 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic RP, yet the genetic bases of {$>$}50\% of the cases, particularly of the recessive forms, remain unknown. Previous linkage analysis in a Spanish consanguineous family allowed us to define a novel autosomal recessive RP (arRP) locus, RP26, within an 11-cM interval (17.4 Mb) on 2q31.2-q32.3. In the present study, we further refine the RP26 locus down to 2. 5 Mb, by microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) homozygosity mapping. After unsuccessful mutational analysis of the nine genes initially reported in this region, a detailed gene search based on expressed-sequence-tag data was undertaken. We finally identified a novel gene encoding a ceramide kinase (CERKL), which encompassed 13 exons. All of the patients from the RP26 family bear a homozygous mutation in exon 5, which generates a premature termination codon. The same mutation was also characterized in another, unrelated, Spanish pedigree with arRP. Human CERKL is expressed in the retina, among other adult and fetal tissues. A more detailed analysis by in situ hybridization on adult murine retina sections shows expression of Cerkl in the ganglion cell layer. Ceramide kinases convert the sphingolipid metabolite ceramide into ceramide-1-phosphate, both key mediators of cellular apoptosis and survival. Ceramide metabolism plays an essential role in the viability of neuronal cells, the membranes of which are particularly rich in sphingolipids. Therefore, CERKL deficiency could shift the relative levels of the signaling sphingolipid metabolites and increase sensitivity of photoreceptor and other retinal cells to apoptotic stimuli. This is the first genetic report suggesting a direct link between retinal neurodegeneration in RP and sphingolipid-mediated apoptosis.},

Myriocin is an inhibitor of SPT and suppresses replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon. However, it is still unknown whether this SPT inhibitor suppresses HCV replication in vivo. We investigated the anti-HCV effect of myriocin against intact HCV using chimeric mice with humanized liver infected with HCV genotype 1a or 1b. We administered myriocin into HCV infected chimeric mice and succeeded in reducing the HCV RNA levels in serum and liver to 1/10-1/100 of the levels prior to the 8 day treatment. Furthermore, combined treatment with pegylated interferon reduced the HCV RNA levels to less than 1/1000 of the control levels. We strongly suggest that suppression of SPT reduces HCV replication, and therefore that the SPT inhibitor is potentially a novel drug in the treatment of HCV infection. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The mechanisms by which Dectin-1 mediates intracellular signaling are just beginning to be defined. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a protein tyrosine kinase that is critical for adaptive immune responses where it mediates signaling through B-cell receptors, T-cell receptors, and Fc receptors. Here we report that Dectin-1 activates Syk in macrophages and is important for Dectin-1-stimulated reactive oxygen production, but not for phagocytosis. Syk activation is restricted to a subpopulation of macrophages that is in equilibrium with cells that cannot activate the pathway. The proportion of macrophages using this signaling pathway can be modulated by cytokine treatment. Thus, Dectin-1 signaling reveals dynamic macrophage heterogeneity in inflammatory activation potential.},

We have further examined the requirements for induction of inflammatory responses such as TNF-alpha production and NF-kappaB activation by zymosan in mouse macrophages. We have observed that direct particle contact is required (excluding a role for soluble components of zymosan preparations) and that contact with a single particle is sufficient to trigger cytokine production. Further, ablation of the Toll-like receptor-stimulating activity of zymosan does not affect the ability of phagocytic receptors to internalise the particle.},

  abstract = {Air pollution leads to inhalation of several pulmonary stimulants that includes particulate matter, and gaseous substances contributing significantly to the development of chronic lung diseases. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of air pollutant mediated pulmonary toxicity remains unclear. This is primarily due to the lack of efficient test systems, mimicing human inhalation exposure scenarios to air pollutants. The majority of the pulmonary in vitro studies have been conducted using cell lines in submerged cell culture conditions and thereby overlooking the pulmonary physiology. Moreover, submerged cell culture systems lack the possibility to measure effective dose measurements. Particle properties, such as size, surface charge, solubility, transformation, or agglomeration state and chemical properties are altered in solution and are dependent on the composition of cell culture medium. Physiologically relevant in vivo-like in vitro models cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) is therefore becoming a realistic and efficient tool for lung toxicity testing and cell-cell interaction studies following exposure to aerosolized or gaseous form of air pollutants. Primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured at ALI leads to differentiate into respiratory epithelium consisting of ciliated cells, goblet cells, club cells and basal cells. ALI system is also considered as a feasible approach to implement the "3R principle"-replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal usage in lung toxicity studies. This review discusses the current understanding of relevance, benefits and limitations of the ALI models in comparison to the existing in vitro and in vivo exposure system for testing air pollutants mediated pulmonary toxicity.},

  abstract = {Macrophages are first-line responders against microbes. The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) rests upon its ability to convert these antimicrobial cells into a permissive cellular niche. This is a remarkable accomplishment, as the antimicrobial arsenal of macrophages is extensive. Normally bacteria are delivered to an acidic, degradative lysosome through one of several trafficking pathways, including LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and autophagy. Once phagocytozed, the bacilli are subjected to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and they induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which serve to augment host responses. However, Mtb hijacks these host defense mechanisms, manipulating host cellular trafficking, innate immune responses, and cell death pathways to its benefit. The complex series of measures and countermeasures between host and pathogen ultimately determines the outcome of infection. In this review, we focus on the diverse effectors that Mtb uses in its multipronged effort to subvert the innate immune responses of macrophages. We highlight recent advances in understanding the molecular interface of the Mtb-macrophage interaction.},

Design of target compounds was mainly based on modifications of the key elements in ceramide and sphingosine, including stereochemistry, the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, the trans double bond in the sphingosine backbone, and the amide bond. Mt-CDase was inhibited by (1) all stereoisomers of D-erythro-ceramide (D-e-Cer) with an IC50 of 0.11, 0.21, and 0.26 mol \% for the L-threo, D-threo, and L-erythro isomers, respectively; (2) all stereoisomers of sphingosine with IC50 ranging from 0.04 to 0.14 mol \%, N-methyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (N-Me-Sph, IC50 0.13 mol \%); and (3) D-erythro-urea-C16-ceramide (C16-urea-Cer IC50 0.33 mol \%). The enzyme was not inhibited by N-methyl ceramide (N-Me-C16-Cer), 1-O-methyl ceramide (1-O-Me-C16-Cer), 3-O-methyl ceramide (3-O-Me-C16-Cer), cis-D-erythro ceramide (cis-D-e-C16-Cer) and 3-O-methyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (3-O-Me-Sph). It was less potently inhibited by D-erythro-sphinganine (D-e-dh-Sph, IC50 0.20 mol \%), D-erythro-dehydro sphingosine (D-e-deh-Sph, IC50 0.25 mol \%), (2S)-3-keto-sphinganine (3-keto-dh-Sph, IC50 0.34 mol \%), (2S) 3-keto-ceramide (3-keto-C16-Cer, IC50 0.60 mol \%), and ceramine (C18-ceramine, IC50 0.62 mol \%), 1-O-methyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (1-O-Me-Sph), cis-D-erythro-sphingosine (cis-D-e-Sph), (2S)-3-ketosphingosine (3-keto-Sph), (2S)-3-keto-dehyrosphingosine (3-keto-deh-Sph), and N,N-dimethyl-D-erythrosphingosine (N,N-diMe-Sph) were weak inhibitors whereas ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer-1-P) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (Sph-1-P) stimulated the enzyme. Thus, for inhibition, the enzyme requires the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, the C4-C5 double bond, the trans configuration of this double bond, and the NH-protons from either the amide of ceramide or the amine of sphingosine. Therefore, these results provide important information on the requirements for ceramide-enzyme interaction, and they suggest that ligand interaction with the enzyme occurs in a high affinity low specificity manner, in contrast to catalysis which is highly specific for D-erythro-ceramide (D-e-Cer) but occurs with a lower affinity. In addition, this study identifies two competitive inhibitors of mt-CDase; urea-ceramide (C16-urea-Cer) and ceramine (C18-ceramine) that may be further developed and used to understand the mechanism of mt-CDase in vitro and in biologic responses.},

They are synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported by ceramide transfer protein to the Golgi for conversion to sphingomyelin (SM) by SM synthase SMS1. In this study, we report the identification of an SMS1-related (SMSr) enzyme, which catalyses the synthesis of the SM analogue ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) in the ER lumen. Strikingly, SMSr produces only trace amounts of CPE, i.e., 300-fold less than SMS1-derived SM. Nevertheless, blocking its catalytic activity causes a substantial rise in ER ceramide levels and a structural collapse of the early secretory pathway. We find that the latter phenotype is not caused by depletion of CPE but rather a consequence of ceramide accumulation in the ER. Our results establish SMSr as a key regulator of ceramide homeostasis that seems to operate as a sensor rather than a converter of ceramides in the ER.},

  abstract = {Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA1, a soil bacterium related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, degrades an exceptionally broad range of organic compounds. Transcriptomic analysis of cholesterol-grown RHA1 revealed a catabolic pathway predicted to proceed via 4-androstene-3,17-dione and 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10- seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione (3,4-DHSA). Inactivation of each of the hsaC, supAB, and mce4 genes in RHA1 substantiated their roles in cholesterol catabolism. Moreover, the hsaC- mutant accumulated 3,4-DHSA, indicating that HsaCRHA1, formerly annotated as a biphenyl-degrading dioxygenase, catalyzes the oxygenolytic cleavage of steroid ring A. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that 51 rhodococcal genes specifically expressed during growth on cholesterol, including all predicted to specify the catabolism of rings A and B, are conserved within an 82-gene cluster in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin. M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin grew on cholesterol, and hsaC and kshA were up-regulated under these conditions. Heterologously produced HsaCH37Rv and HsaDH37Rv transformed 3,4-DHSA and its ring-cleaved product, respectively, with apparent specificities ≈40-fold higher than for the corresponding biphenyl metabolites. Overall, we annotated 28 RHA1 genes and proposed physiological roles for a similar number of mycobacterial genes. During survival of M. tuberculosis in the macrophage, these genes are specifically expressed, and many appear to be essential. We have delineated a complete suite of genes necessary for microbial steroid degradation, and pathogenic mycobacteria have been shown to catabolize cholesterol. The results suggest that cholesterol metabolism is central to M. tuberculosis's unusual ability to survive in macrophages and provide insights into potential targets for novel therapeutics. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Invading pathogens are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptors such as C-type lectins expressed on the surface of DCs. However, it is becoming evident that some pathogens, including viruses, such as HIV-1, and non-viral pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, subvert DC functions to escape immune surveillance by targeting the C-type lectin DC-SIGN (DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin). Notably, these pathogens misuse DC-SIGN by distinct mechanisms that either circumvent antigen processing or alter TLR-mediated signalling, skewing T-cell responses. This implies that adaptation of pathogens to target DC-SIGN might support pathogen survival.},

  abstract = {The visualization of fluorescent proteins in living cells is a powerful approach to study intracellular dynamics. A limitation of fluorescence imaging, however, is that it lacks fine structural information; a fluorescent spot could represent an entire organelle, an organellar subdomain or even aggregates of proteins or membranes. These limitations can be overcome by immuno-electron microscopy (immunoEM), which uniquely combines protein detection with ultrastructural detail. Electron microscopy (EM ), however, requires fixation of the cells, resulting in static images with only limited information on membrane dynamics. To bridge the gap between live-cell imaging and EM , several laboratories have developed procedures for so-called correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM). In CLEM, fluorescently tagged proteins are first imaged by light microscopy and then visualized via EM by immunolabeling1-3 or di-aminobenzidine photoconversion4-7. None of the current CLEM approaches use the cryo-immunogold method, which is probably the most optimal method for immunoEM8. Here we introduce a CLEM approach that integrates imaging of fluorescent proteins in live cells with the cryo-immunogold technique (Fig. 1) by modifying our previously published CLEM approach on fixed cells9 at several steps (Box 1). Briefly, gridded coverslips are coated with Formvar and gelatin, according to an optimized protocol (Steps 1-11 and Supplementary Table 1 online). Cells destined for CLEM are grown on these gridded coverslips (Steps 12-17), which facilitates tracing back their location in the electron microscope. After live-cell imaging (Steps 18-22), cells are detached from the coverslip (Step 23, the process is efficient due to the Formvar and gelatin coating of the coverslip) and prepared for electron microscopy (Steps 24-32). Using this approach, we monitored the kinetics and localization at nanometer resolution of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 in live cells (Fig. 2).},

Notably, all such reports were limited to Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we unravel a highly devolved mechanism for recruitment of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles during phagosome biogenesis, which was important for uptake of most cargos, except the IgG-coated ones. We report recruitment of mannosidase-IIpositive Golgi-derived vesicles during uptake of diverse targets, including latex beads, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human and mouse macrophages. The recruitment of mannosidase-II vesicles was an early event mediated by focal exocytosis and coincided with the recruitment of transferrin receptor, VAMP3, and dynamin-2. Brefeldin A treatment inhibited mannosidase-II recruitment and phagocytic uptake of seru m-coated or-uncoated latex beads and E. coli. However, consistent with previous studies, brefeldin A treatment did not affect uptake of IgG-coated latex beads. Mechanistically, recruitment of mannosidase-II vesicles during phagocytic uptake required Ca 2+ from both extra-and intracellular sources apart from PI3K, microtubules, and dynamin-2. Extracellular Ca 2+ via voltagegated Ca 2+ channels established a Ca 2+ -dependent local phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate gradient, which guides the focal movement of Golgi-derived vesicles to the site of uptake. We confirmed Golgi-derived vesicles recruited during phagocytosis were secretory vesicles as their recruitment was sensitive to depletion of VAMP2 or NCS1, whereas recruitment of the recycling endosome marker VAMP3 was unaffected. Depletion of both VAMP2 and NCS1 individually resulted in the reduced uptake by macrophages. Together, the study provides a previously unprecedented role of Golgiderived secretory vesicles in phagocytic uptake, the key innate defense function.},

  abstract = {The longevity assurance gene (LAG1) and its homolog (LAC1) are required for acyl-CoA-dependent synthesis of ceramides containinn-g very long acyl chain (e.g. C26) fatty acids in yeast, and a homolog of LAG1, ASC1, confers resistance in plants to fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthesis. To understand further the mechanism of regulation of ceramide synthesis, we now characterize a mammalian homolog of LAG1, upstream of growth and differentiation factor-1 (uog1). cDNA clones of uog1 were obtained from expression sequence-tagged clones and sub-cloned into a mammalian expression vector. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells with uog1 followed by metabolic labeling with [4,5-3H]sphinganine or L-3-[3H]serine demonstrated that uog1 conferred fumonisin B1 resistance with respect to the ability of the cells to continue to produce ceramide. Surprisingly, this ceramide was channeled into neutral glycosphingolipids but not into gangliosides. Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the elevation in sphingolipids and revealed that the ceramides and neutral glycosphingolipids of uog1-transfected cells contain primarily stearic acid (C18), that this enrichment was further increased by FB1, and that the amount of stearic acid in sphingomyelin was also increased. UOG1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrating that the fatty acid selectivity and the fumonisin B1 resistance are not due to a subcellular localization different from that found previously for ceramide synthase activity. Furthermore, in vitro assays of uog1-transfected cells demonstrated elevated ceramide synthase activity when stearoyl-CoA but not palmitoyl-CoA was used as substrate. We propose a role for UOG1 in regulating C18-ceramide (N-stearoyl-sphinganine) synthesis, and we note that not only is this the first case of ceramide formation in mammalian cells with such a high degree of fatty acid specificity, but also that the N-stearoyl-sphinganine produced by UOG1 most significantly impacts neutral glycosphingolipid synthesis.},

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) lyase (SPL) is an intracellular enzyme that mediates the irreversible degradation of the bioactive lipid S1P. We have previously reported that overexpressed SPL displays anti-influenza viral activity; however, the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that SPL functions as a positive regulator of IKK to propel type I IFN-mediated innate immune responses against viral infection. Exogenous SPL expression inhibited influenza A virus replication, which correlated with an increase in type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene accumulation upon infection. In contrast, the lack of SPL expression led to an elevated cellular susceptibility to influenza Avirus infection. In support of this, SPLdeficient cells were defective in mounting an effective IFN response when stimulated by influenza viral RNAs. SPL augmented the activation status of IKK and enhanced the kinase-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and the synthesis of type I IFNs. However, the S1P degradation-incompetent form of SPL also enhanced IFN responses, suggesting that SPL's pro-IFN function is independent of S1P. Biochemical analyses revealed that SPL, as well as the mutant form of SPL, interacts with IKK. Importantly, when endogenous IKK was downregulated using a small interfering RNA approach, SPL's anti-influenza viral activity was markedly suppressed. This indicates that IKK is crucial for SPL-mediated inhibition of influenza virus replication. Thus, the results illustrate the functional significance of the SPL-IKK-IFN axis during host innate immunity against viral infection.},

  abstract = {SMS [SM (sphingomyelin) synthase] is a class of enzymes that produces SM by transferring a phosphocholine moiety on to ceramide. PC (phosphatidylcholine) is believed to be the phosphocholine donor of the reaction with consequent production of DAG (diacylglycerol), an important bioactive lipid. In the present study, by modulating SMS1 and SMS2 expression, the role of these enzymes on the elusive regulation of DAG was investigated. Because we found that modulation of SMS1 or SMS2 did not affect total levels of endogenous DAG in resting cells, whereas they produce DAG in vitro, the possibility that SMSs could modulate subcellular pools of DAG, once acute activation of the enzymes is triggered, was investigated. Stimulation of SM synthesis was induced by either treatment with short-chain ceramide analogues or by increasing endogenous ceramide at the plasma membrane, and a fluorescently labelled conventional C1 domain [from PKC (protein kinase C)] enhanced in its DAG binding activity was used to probe subcellular pools of DAG in the cell. With this approach, we found, using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, that modulation of SMS1 and, to a lesser extent, SMS2 affected the formation of DAG at the Golgi apparatus. Similarly, down-regulation of SMS1 and SMS2 reduced the localization of the DAG-binding protein PKD (protein kinase D) to the Golgi. These results provide direct evidence that both enzymes are capable of regulating the formation of DAG in cells, that this pool of DAG is biologically active, and for the first time directly implicate SMS1 and SMS2 as regulators of DAG-binding proteins in the Golgi apparatus.},

Recently, large-scale approaches have been used to improve our understanding of phagosome functional properties by the identification of hundreds of proteins and by studying each of them.},

  abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide variety of infections and antibiotic resistant strains are a major problem in hospitals. One of the best studied virulence factors of S. aureus is the pore-forming toxin alpha hemolysin (αHL) whose mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We performed a genome-wide loss-of-function screen using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to identify host targets required for αHL susceptibility in human myeloid cells. We found gRNAs for ten genes enriched after intoxication with αHL and focused on the top five hits. Besides a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), the host receptor for αHL, we identified three proteins, Sys1 golgi trafficking protein (SYS1), ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARFRP1), and tetraspanin-14 (TSPAN14) which regulate the presentation of ADAM10 on the plasma membrane post-translationally. Interestingly, we also showed that cells lacking sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SGMS1) resist αHL intoxication, but have only a slightly reduced ADAM10 surface expression. SGMS1 regulates lipid raft formation, suggesting that αHL requires these membrane microdomains for attachment and cytotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens that can invade and survive within host macrophages. Mycobacterial infections remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with serious concerns of emergence of multi and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. While significant advances have been made in identifying mycobacterial virulence determinants, the detailed molecular mechanism of internalization of mycobacteria into host cells remains poorly understood. Although several studies have highlighted the crucial role of sphingolipids in mycobacterial growth, persistence and establishment of infection, the role of sphingolipids in the entry of mycobacteria into host cells is not known. In this work, we explored the role of host membrane sphingolipids in the entry of Mycobacterium smegmatis into J774A.1 macrophages. Our results show that metabolic depletion of sphingolipids in host macrophages results in a significant reduction in the entry of M. smegmatis. Importantly, the entry of Escherichia coli into host macrophages under similar conditions remained invariant, implying the specificity of the requirement of sphingolipids in mycobacterial entry. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first report demonstrating the role of host macrophage sphingolipids in the entry of mycobacteria. Our results could help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting sphingolipid-mediated entry of mycobacteria into host cells.},

Moreover, NK cells do not react in an invariant manner but rather adapt to their environment. Finally, recent studies have unveiled that NK cells can also mount a form of antigen-specific immunologic memory.

The quality of reporting was assessed according to the Jadad scale; only studies with a score of 3 or more were included. The outcomes evaluated were mycological cure at the end of treatment, sustained cure, occurrence of adverse events and tolerability, including withdrawals due to adverse events. A total of 104 RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, containing a total of 135 comparisons, with 55 out of 120 possible comparisons among the 16 drugs evaluated. Pooled data on efficacy showed that all the antifungals were better than placebo. There were no significant differences among antifungal classes. No differences were found in safety or tolerability in any direct comparison. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the findings. Our results indicate the clear superiority of topical antifungals over placebo but that there is no consistent difference among classes. Mixed treatment comparisons are necessary to rank antifungals, as direct comparisons among many of them are lacking.},

It acts as a receptor for neuromediators and growth factors at the plasma membrane, but it has also been implicated in binding and transport of some lysosomal proteins. However, the role of sortilin during phagosome maturation has not been investigated before. Here, we show that in macrophages, sortilin is mainly localized in the Golgi and transported to latex-bead phagosomes (LBPs). Using live-cell imaging and electron microscopy, we found that sortilin is delivered to LBPs in a manner that depends on its cytoplasmic tail. We also show that sortilin participates in the direct delivery of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and prosaposin (PS) to the phagosome, bypassing fusion with lysosomal compartments. Further analysis confirmed that ASM and PS are targeted to the phagosome by sortilin in a Brefeldin-A-sensitive pathway. Analysis of primary macrophages isolated from Sort1 -/- mice indicated that the delivery of ASM and PS, but not pro-cathepsin D, to LBPs was severely impaired. We propose a pathway mediated by sortilin by which selected lysosomal proteins are transported to the phagosome along a Golgi-dependent route during the maturation of phagosomes.},

Acute-stage tachyzoites differentiate into chronic-stage bradyzoites, which form intracellular cysts resistant to immune clearance and existing therapies. The molecular basis of this differentiation is unknown, despite being efficiently triggered by stresses in culture. Through Cas9-mediated screening and single-cell profiling, we identify a Myb-like transcription factor (BFD1) necessary for differentiation in cell culture and in mice. BFD1 accumulates during stress and its synthetic expression is sufficient to drive differentiation. Consistent with its function as a transcription factor, BFD1 binds the promoters of many stage-specific genes and represents a counterpoint to the ApiAP2 factors that dominate our current view of parasite gene regulation. BFD1 provides a genetic switch to study and control Toxoplasma differentiation and will inform prevention and treatment of chronic infections.},

Seventeen loci surpass genome-wide significance for infection-associated phenotypes ranging from pathogen replication to cytokine production. We combined H2P2 with clinical association data from patients to identify a SNP near CXCL10 as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. A SNP in the transcriptional repressor ZBTB20 demonstrated pleiotropy, likely through suppression of multiple target genes, and was associated with viral hepatitis. These data are available on a web portal to facilitate interpreting human genome variation through the lens of cell biology and should serve as a rich resource for the research community. Approaches are needed for a deeper understanding of how human genetics impacts disease susceptibility.

  abstract = {Sphingolipids are a class of membrane lipids that serve as vital structural and signaling bioactive molecules in organisms ranging from yeast to animals. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of sphingolipids as signaling molecules in the development and pathogenicity of microbial pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In particular, sphingolipids play key roles in regulating the delicate balance between microbes and hosts during microbial pathogenesis. Some pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, harness host sphingolipids to promote development and infection, whereas sphingolipids from both the host and pathogen are involved in fungus–host interactions. Moreover, a regulatory role for sphingolipids has been described, but their effects on host physiology and metabolism remain to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the roles of sphingolipids in pathogenesis and interactions with host factors, including how sphingolipids modify pathogen and host metabolism with a focus on pathogenesis regulators and relevant metabolic enzymes. In addition, we discuss emerging perspectives on targeting sphingolipids that function in host–microbe interactions as new therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases.},

Macrophages have been suggested as the main host cell to initiate the innate immune responses to NTM infection. However, the molecular mechanism to regulate the antimicrobial immune responses to NTM is still largely unknown. Current study showed that the NTM clinical groups,               Mycobacterium abscessus               and               Mycobacterium smegmatis,               significantly induced the M1 macrophage polarization with the characteristic production of nitric oxide (NO) and marker gene expression of iNOS, IFNγ, TNF‐α, IL1‐β and IL‐6. Interestingly, a non‐histone nuclear protein, HMGN2 (high‐mobility group N2), was found to be spontaneously induced during NTM‐activated M1 macrophage polarization. Functional studies revealed that HMGN2 deficiency in NTM‐infected macrophage promotes the expression of M1 markers and the production of NO via the enhanced activation of NF‐κB and MAPK signalling. Further studies exhibited that HMGN2 knock‐down also enhanced IFNγ‐induced M1 macrophage polarization. Finally, we observed that silencing HMGN2 affected the survival of NTM in macrophage, which might largely relevant to enhanced macrophage polarization into M1 phenotype under the NTM infection. Collectively, current studies thus suggested a novel function of HMGN2 in regulating the anti‐non‐tuberculous mycobacteria innate immunity of macrophage.},

The causative agents are thought to be a family of compounds called fumonisins, which bear considerable structural similarity to the long-chain (sphingoid) base backbones of sphingolipids. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with fumonisins inhibited incorporation of [14C]serine into the sphingosine moiety of cellular sphingolipids with an IC50 of 0.1 microM for fumonisin B1. In contrast, fumonisin B1 increased the amount of the biosynthetic intermediate sphinganine, which suggests that fumonisins inhibit the conversion of [14C]sphinganine to N-acyl-[14C]sphinganines, a step that is thought to precede introduction of the 4,5-trans double bond of sphingosine (Merrill, A.H., Jr. and Wang, E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3764-3769). In agreement with this mechanism, fumonisin B1 inhibited the activity of sphingosine N-acyltransferase (ceramide synthase) in rat liver microsomes with 50\% inhibition at approximately 0.1 microM and reduced the conversion of [3H]sphingosine to [3H]ceramide by intact hepatocytes. As far as we are aware, this is the first discovery of a naturally occurring inhibitor of this step of sphingolipid metabolism. These findings suggest that disruption of the de novo pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis may be a critical event in the diseases that have been associated with consumption of fumonisins.},

As a central enzyme in modulating the S1P levels in cells, SphK1 emerges as an important regulator for diverse cellular functions and a potential target for drug discovery. Here, we present the crystal structures of human SphK1 in the apo form and in complexes with a substrate sphingosine-like lipid, ADP, and an inhibitor at 2.0-2.3 Å resolution. The SphK1 structures reveal a two-domain architecture in which its catalytic site is located in the cleft between the two domains and a hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket is buried in the C-terminal domain. Comparative analysis of these structures with mutagenesis and kinetic studies provides insight into how SphK1 recognizes the lipid substrate and catalyzes ATP-dependent phosphorylation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: Macrophages mediate phagocytosis via cell-surface pattern-recognition-receptors (PRRs) known to recognize certain fixed patterns on pathogens. Of these PRRs, scavenger receptors class A I and II (SR-A I and II) are known to mediate the binding and internalization of a large variety of Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacteria. Their role in phagocytic clearance of fungal agents has not been described. Methods: Fluorescence microscopy and phagocytosis assays were used on murine macrophage cell lines RAW264.7. Chinese hamster ovarian cell lines (CHO) transfected with SR-A-I or SRA-II and known ligands that block SRA-uptake were used to test the ability of these cells to bind fungal agents. Macrophages from mice genetically deficient in SRA (MSR-knockouts) were used to establish whether absence of these receptors affects fungal uptake. Results: We show for the first time that the SR-A I and II on macrophages are involved in both the binding and phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans. SRA-mediated binding and internalization of these pathogens is specifically inhibited by known ligands of SRA (Fucoidan and Poly G) in a dose-titratable manner. Further, CHO cells transfected with either SR-A-I or SRA-II show an increased ability to bind and internalize S. cerevisiae compared with the non-transfected parental cells. In contrast, the macrophages that are deficient in the scavenger receptor (obtained from MSR-/- mice) do not show a decreased ability to phagocytose fungal agents. Conclusions: Scavenger receptors mediate phagocytosis of fungal agents, representing perhaps an alternative, fall back mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the past decades, helminth infections are becoming less prevalent possibly due to the developed sanitation. Meanwhile, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is increasing, which cannot be exclusively explained by the changes of susceptibility genes. While the hygiene hypothesis casts light on the problem. The infections of helminths are believed to interact with and regulate human immunity with the byproduct of suppressing the autoimmune diseases. Thus, helminths are potential to treat or cure the autoimmune diseases. The therapeutic progresses and possible immune suppression mechanisms are illustrated in the review. The helminths that are studied most intensively include Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Hymenolepis diminuta, Schistosoma mansoni, Trichinella spiralis, and Trichuris suis. Special attentions are paid on the booming animal models and clinical trials that are to detect the efficiency of immune-modulating helminth-derived molecules on autoimmune diseases. These trials provide us with a prosperous clinical perspective, but the precise mechanism of the down-regulatory immune response remains to be clarified. More efforts are needed to be dedicated until these parasite-derived immune modulators could be used in clinic to treat or cure the autoimmune diseases under a standard management.},

It was thought to be caused by heredity compounded by one’s way of life and, even when proved to be an infection, these factors were thought to identify who would catch it. In 1854 Hermann Brehmer asserted that he could cure tuberculosis with a regimen of fresh air, exercise and good nutrition in a sanatorium. Although the medical establishment initially rejected Brehmer’s ideas the sanatorium movement steadily caught hold, and within two decades was supported by eminent physicians. Rest replaced Brehmer’s exercise, as the key remedy. The sanatorium regimen put Galenic principles of hygiene into practice.},

The immunological interaction between HIV-1 and Mtb has been largely defined by how the virus exacerbates tuberculosis disease pathogenesis. Understanding of the mechanisms by which pre-existing or subsequent Mtb infection may favor the replication, persistence and progression of HIV, is less characterized. We present a rationale for the critical consideration of ‘latent’ Mtb infection in HIV-1 prevention and cure strategies. In support of this position, we review evidence of the effect of Mtb infection on HIV-1 acquisition, replication and persistence. We propose that ‘latent’ Mtb infection may have considerable impact on HIV-1 pathogenesis and the continuing HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.           ,              Graphical abstract             The proposed impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb) coinfection (solid lines) on the life-course progression of HIV-1 infection (dotted lines). In addition to enhancing the speed of AIDS progression and tuberculosis development in those HIV-1 infected, Mtb infection increases myeloid and T-cell immune activation and the susceptibility of cells to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 replication in infected and bystander cells. Following antiretroviral therapy initiation, a larger pool of reservoir cells harboring HIV-1 and higher immune activation status has the potential to result in more frequent blips in viremia above the level of clinical detection (thin line).

However, substantial run-to-run variability in intensities and observations (presence/absence) of peptides makes data analysis quite challenging. The missing observations in LC-MS proteomics data are difficult to address with traditional imputation-based approaches because the mechanisms by which data are missing are unknown a priori. Data can be missing due to random mechanisms such as experimental error or nonrandom mechanisms such as a true biological effect. We present a statistical approach that uses a test of independence known as a G-test to test the null hypothesis of independence between the number of missing values across experimental groups. We pair the G-test results, evaluating independence of missing data (IMD) with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) that uses only means and variances computed from the observed data. Each peptide is therefore represented by two statistical confidence metrics, one for qualitative differential observation and one for quantitative differential intensity. We use three LC-MS data sets to demonstrate the robustness and sensitivity of the IMD-ANOVA approach. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase (UGCG) is a key enzyme in the sphingolipid metabolism by generating glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the precursor for all glycosphingolipids (GSL), which are essential for proper cell function. Interestingly, the UGCG is also overexpressed in several cancer types and correlates with multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) gene expression. This membrane protein is responsible for efflux of toxic substances and protects cancer cells from cell damage through chemotherapeutic agents. Studies showed a connection between UGCG and MDR1 overexpression and multidrug resistance development, but the precise underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we give an overview about the UGCG and its connection to MDR1 in multidrug resistant cells. Furthermore, we focus on UGCG transcriptional regulation, the impact of UGCG on cellular signaling pathways and the effect of UGCG and MDR1 on the lipid composition of membranes and how this could influence multidrug resistance development. To our knowledge, this is the first review presenting an overview about UGCG with focus on the relationship to MDR1 in the process of multidrug resistance development.},

In addition, mice lacking Mincle showed a significantly increased susceptibility to systemic candidiasis.

Previously, we reported that lipids shed by pathogenic mycobacteria inhibit NPC1, the lysosomal membrane protein deficient in the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). Inhibition of NPC1 leads to a drop in lysosomal calcium levels, blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion leading to mycobacterial survival. We speculated that the production of specific cell wall lipid(s) that inhibit NPC1 could have been a critical step in the evolution of pathogenicity. We therefore investigated whether lipid extracts from clinical Mtb strains from multiple Mtb lineages, Mtb complex (MTBC) members and non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM) inhibit the NPC pathway. We report that inhibition of the NPC pathway was present in all clinical isolates from Mtb lineages 1, 2, 3 and 4, Mycobacterium bovis and the NTM, Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium avium. However, lipid extract from Mycobacterium canettii, which is considered to resemble the common ancestor of the MTBC did not inhibit the NPC1 pathway. We conclude that the evolution of NPC1 inhibitory mycobacterial cell wall lipids evolved early and post divergence from Mycobacterium canettii-related mycobacteria and that this activity contributes significantly to the promotion of disease.},

  abstract = {Microbial products are sensed through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger a program of dendritic call (DC) maturation that enables DCs to activate T cells. Although an accepted hallmark of this response is eventual down-regulation of DC endocytic capacity, we show that TLR ligands first acutely stimulate antigen macropinocytosis, leading to enhanced presentation on class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. Simultaneously, actin-rich podosomes disappear, which suggests a coordinated redeployment of actin to fuel endocytosis. These reciprocal changes are transient and require p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Thus, the DC actin cytoskeleton can be rapidly mobilized in response to innate immune stimuli to enhance antigen capture and presentation.},

During infection, M. tuberculosis maintains viability by extracting and utilizing essential nutrients from the host, and this is a prerequisite for all of the pathogenic activities that are deployed by the bacterium. In particular, M. tuberculosis preferentially acquires and metabolizes host-derived lipids (fatty acids and cholesterol), and the bacterium utilizes these substrates to cause and maintain disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of lipid utilization by M. tuberculosis, and we describe how these pathways promote pathogenesis to fuel metabolic processes in the bacillus. Finally, we highlight weaknesses in these pathways that potentially can be targeted for drug discovery.},

The observed rapid outward migration of Saturn’s largest satellite, Titan, could have raised Saturn’s obliquity through a spin-orbit precession resonance with Neptune. We use Cassini data to refine estimates of Saturn’s moment of inertia, finding that it is just outside the range required for the resonance. We propose that Saturn previously had an additional satellite, which we name Chrysalis, that caused Saturn’s obliquity to increase through the Neptune resonance. Destabilization of Chrysalis’s orbit \textasciitilde 100 million years ago can then explain the proximity of the system to the resonance and the formation of the rings through a grazing encounter with Saturn.           ,              How did Saturn get its rings?

Wisdom               et al               . propose that the Saturn system previously contained an additional moon, the orbit of which was perturbed by the orbital migration of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon (see the Perspective by El Moutamid). The authors used numerical simulations to show that the perturbation would have eventually destabilized the system, scattering the additional moon. If it came too close to Saturn, the moon would have been ripped apart by tidal forces, forming the rings. The scenario explains several otherwise puzzling properties of Saturn’s tilt and the orbits of its other moons and is consistent with the measured age and mass of the rings. —KTS                        ,              Saturn’s rings could have formed by ripping apart a former moon of the giant planet, scattered by orbital resonances.},

  abstract = {Anterograde transport of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from neuronal cell bodies into, and down, axons is a fundamentally important process for spread to other hosts. Different techniques for imaging HSV in axons have produced two models for how virus particles are transported in axons. In the Separate model, viral nucleocapsids devoid of the viral envelope and membrane glycoproteins are transported in axons. In the Married model, enveloped HSV particles (with the viral glycoproteins) encased within membrane vesicles are transported in the anterograde direction. Earlier studies of HSV-infected human neurons involving electron microscopy (EM) and immunofluorescence staining of glycoproteins and capsids supported the Separate model. However, more-recent live-cell imaging of rat, chicken, and mouse neurons produced evidence supporting the Married model. In a recent EM study, a mixture of Married (75\%) and Separate (25\%) HSV particles was observed. Here, we studied an HSV recombinant expressing a fluorescent form of the viral glycoprotein gB and a fluorescent capsid protein (VP26), observing that human SK-N-SH neurons contained both Separate (the majority) and Married particles. Live-cell imaging of rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neuronal axons in a chamber system (which oriented the axons) also produced evidence of Separate and Married particles. Together, our results suggest that one can observe anterograde transport of both HSV capsids and enveloped virus particles depending on which neurons are cultured and how the neurons are imaged.},

  abstract = {The Rac activator Tiam1 is required for adherens junction (AJ) maintenance, and its depletion results in AJ disassembly. Conversely, the oncoprotein Src potently induces AJ disassembly and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that Tiam1 is phosphorylated on Y384 by Src. This occurs predominantly at AJs, is required for Src-induced AJ disassembly and cell migration, and creates a docking site on Tiam1 for Grb2. We find that Tiam1 is associated with ERK. Following recruitment of the Grb2-Sos1 complex, ERK becomes activated and triggers the localized degradation of Tiam1 at AJs, likely involving calpain proteases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in human tumors, Y384 phosphorylation positively correlates with Src activity, and total Tiam1 levels are inversely correlated. Thus, our data implicate Tiam1 phosphorylation and consequent degradation in Src-mediated EMT and resultant cell motility and establish a paradigm for regulating local concentrations of Rho-GEFs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  title = {{{WHO}} Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis. {{Module}} 4, {{Treatment}} : Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment.},
  author = {{World Health Organization}},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) strains with drug resistance (DR-TB) are more difficult to treat than drug-susceptible ones, and threaten global progress towards the targets set by the End TB Strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO estimates that about half a million cases of multi-drug or rifampicin resistant (MDR/RR-TB) are estimated to occur each year. However, only one third were estimated to have accessed effective treatment and of those, just over half had a successful treatment outcome. Therefore, there is a pressing need for evidence-based policy recommendations on the treatment and care of patients with DR-TB, based on the most recent and comprehensive evidence available. In this regard, the WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis, Module 4: Treatment - Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment fulfills the mandate of WHO to inform health care professionals in Member States on how to improve treatment and care for patients with DR-TB. The 2020 recommendations on drug resistant TB treatment are contained in the second module to be released under the rubric of WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis (Module 4: Treatment). The WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis will group all TB recommendations in one document and will be complemented by matching modules of a consolidated operational handbook. The operational handbook will provide practical advice on how to put in place the recommendations at the scale needed to achieve national and global impact. OVERVIEW: Between 2011 and 2019, WHO has developed and issued evidence-based policy recommendations on the treatment and care of patients with DR-TB. These policy recommendations have been presented in several WHO documents and their associated annexes, including the WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment, issued by WHO in March 2019. The policy recommendations in each of these guidelines have been developed by WHO-convened Guideline Development Groups, using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to summarize the evidence, and formulate policy recommendations and accompanying remarks. The present WHO Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis, Module 4: Treatment - Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment includes a comprehensive set of WHO recommendations for the treatment and care of DR-TB. The document includes two new recommendations, one on the composition of shorter regimens and one on the use of the BPaL regimen (i.e. bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid). In addition, the consolidated guidelines include existing recommendations on treatment regimens for isoniazid-resistant TB and MDR/RR-TB, including longer regimens, culture monitoring of patients on treatment, the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in MDR/RR-TB patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the use of surgery for patients receiving MDR-TB treatment, and optimal models of patient support and care. The guidelines are to be used primarily in national TB programmes, or their equivalents in Ministries of Health, and for other policy-makers and technical organizations working on TB and infectious diseases in public and private sectors and in the community.},

To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the most severe diseases worldwide. The initial pulmonary localization of the pathogen often develops into systemic infection with high lethality. The present work investigated the role of sphingolipids, specifically the function of acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and ceramide, in infection of murine macrophages in vitro and mice in vivo with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). In vitro, we investigated macrophages from wild-type (wt) and Asm deficient (Asm−/−) mice to define signaling events induced by BCG infection and mediated by Asm. We demonstrate that infection of wt macrophages results in activation of Asm, which increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) via stimulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. ROS promote BCG degradation by cathepsin D. Asm deficiency in macrophages abrogates these effects. In vivo studies reveal that wt mice rapidly control BCG infection, while Asm−/− mice fail to control the infection and kill the bacteria. Transplantation of wt macrophages into Asm−/− mice reversed their susceptibility to BCG, demonstrating the importance of Asm in macrophages for defense against BCG. These findings indicate that Asm is important for the control of BCG infection.},

  abstract = {Patients with the neurological disorder HSAN-I suffer frequent infections, attributed to a lack of pain sensation and failure to seek care for minor injuries. Whether protective CD8+ T cells are affected in HSAN-I patients remains unknown. Here, we report that HSAN-I-associated mutations in serine palmitoyltransferase subunit SPTLC2 dampened human T cell responses. Antigen stimulation and inflammation induced SPTLC2 expression, and murine T-cell-specific ablation of Sptlc2 impaired antiviral-T-cell expansion and effector function. Sptlc2 deficiency reduced sphingolipid biosynthetic flux and led to prolonged activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress, and CD8+ T cell death. Protective CD8+ T cell responses in HSAN-I patient PBMCs and Sptlc2-deficient mice were restored by supplementing with sphingolipids and pharmacologically inhibiting ER stress-induced cell death. Therefore, SPTLC2 underpins protective immunity by translating extracellular stimuli into intracellular anabolic signals and antagonizes ER stress to promote T cell metabolic fitness.},

In gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a score that can combine fold change and P-value together is needed for better gene ranking.Results: We defined a gene significance score π-value by combining expression fold change and statistical significance (P-value), and explored its statistical properties. When compared to various existing methods, π-value based approach is more robust in selecting DE genes, with the largest area under curve in its receiver operating characteristic curve. We applied π-value to GSEA and found it comparable to P-value and t-statistic based methods, with added protection against false discovery in certain situations. Finally, in a gene functional study of breast cancer profiles, we showed that using π-value helps elucidating otherwise overlooked important biological functions. © 2013 The Author 2013.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these assembly events are unclear. Here, we show that dengue nonstructural protein 2A (NS2A protein) recruits viral RNA, structural proteins, and protease to the site of virion assembly and coordinates nucleocapsid and virus formation. The last 285 nucleotides of viral 3′ UTR serve as a “recruiting signal for packaging” that binds to a cytosolic loop of NS2A. This interaction allows NS2A to recruit nascent RNA from the replication complex to the virion assembly site. NS2A also recruits the C-prM-E polyprotein and NS2B-NS3 protease to the virion assembly site by interacting with prM, E, and NS3, leading to coordinated C-prM-E cleavage. Mature C protein assembles onto genomic RNA to form nucleocapsid, followed by prM and E envelopment and virion formation.},

  abstract = {In the year 1821, Sir Archibald Edmonstone, whose interesting work on two of the Oäses of Upper Egypt has been so favourably received by the public, presented me with a mummy, which he had purchased at Gournou, on the 24th of March, 1819, from one of the inhabitants of the sepulchral excavations on the side of the mountain, at the back of which are the celebrated tombs of the kings of Thebes. It cost about four dollars. There was no outer case to it; and it is difficult to conceive how the beauty and perfect condition of the surface of the single case in which the mummy was inclosed, could have been so well preserved without any external covering. It appears from Sir Archibald’s testimony, confirmed by my own observations, that the mummies which have a second, or an outer case, like the one bought at the same time by Sir Archibald Edmondstone’s fellow traveller, Mr. Hoghton, and now lying unopened at his seat near Preston, in Lancashire, have been folded, externally, with greater care than the one about to be described; and that the outward folds are ornamented with variegated stripes of linen. These observations accord with those made by Jomard and Royer. The first, or inner case, too, of those mummies is covered with a kind of paper, on which the figures and hieroglyphics are painted with much greater brilliancy of colour. Similar remarks apply to the mummy presented to the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow, by Mr. Heywood, a Smyrna merchant, the second or inner case of which is said to be of wonderful beauty and brilliancy.},

  abstract = {Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a lysosomal phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide and phosphocholine. While other lysosomal sphingolipid hydrolases require a saposin activator protein for full activity, the ASM polypeptide incorporates a built-in N-terminal saposin domain and does not require an external activator protein. Here, we report the crystal structure of human ASM and describe the organization of the three main regions of the enzyme: the N-terminal saposin domain, the proline-rich connector, and the catalytic domain. The saposin domain is tightly associated along an edge of the large, bowl-shaped catalytic domain and adopts an open form that exposes a hydrophobic concave surface approximately 30 Å from the catalytic center. The calculated electrostatic potential of the enzyme is electropositive at the acidic pH of the lysosome, consistent with the strict requirement for the presence of acidic lipids in target membranes. Docking studies indicate that sphingomyelin binds with the ceramide-phosphate group positioned at the binuclear zinc center and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the intrinsic flexibility of the saposin domain is important for monomer-dimer exchange and for membrane interactions. Overall, ASM uses a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to cause local disruptions of target bilayers in order to bring the lipid headgroup to the catalytic center in a membrane-bound reaction.},

  abstract = {Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and play an important role in the signaling of ITAM-bearing lymphocyte antigen receptors. Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) that recognizes β-glucan in the cell walls of fungi and triggers signal transduction via its cytoplasmic hemi-ITAM. However, it is not known if similar to antigen receptors, Dectin-1 would also signal via lipid rafts and if the integrity of lipid raft microdomains is important for the physiological functions mediated by Dectin-1. We demonstrate here using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and confocal microscopy that Dectin-1 translocates to lipid rafts upon stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) with the yeast derivative zymosan or β-glucan. In addition, two key signaling molecules, Syk and PLCγ2 are also recruited to lipid rafts upon the activation of Dectin-1, suggesting that lipid raft microdomains facilitate Dectin-1 signaling. Disruption of lipid raft integrity with the synthetic drug, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (βmD) leads to reduced intracellular Ca2+ flux and defective Syk and ERK phosphorylation in Dectin-1-activated DCs. Furthermore, βmD-treated DCs have significantly attenuated production of IL-2, IL-10, and TNFα upon Dectin-1 engagement, and they also exhibit impaired phagocytosis of zymosan particles. Taken together, the data indicate that Dectin-1 and perhaps also other CLRs are recruited to lipid rafts upon activation and that the integrity of lipid rafts is important for the signaling and cellular functions initiated by this class of innate receptors. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

It invades the intestinal epithelium to elicit intense inflammation and tissue damage, yet the underlying mechanisms of its host selectivity and low infectious inoculum remain perplexing. Here, we report that Shigella co-opts human α-defensin 5 (HD5), a host defense peptide important for intestinal homeostasis and innate immunity, to enhance its adhesion to and invasion of mucosal tissues. HD5 promoted Shigella infection in vitro in a structure-dependent manner. Shigella, commonly devoid of an effective host-adhesion apparatus, preferentially targeted HD5 to augment its ability to colonize the intestinal epithelium through interactions with multiple bacterial membrane proteins. HD5 exacerbated infectivity and Shigella-induced pathology in a culture of human colorectal tissues and three animal models. Our findings illuminate how Shigella exploits innate immunity by turning HD5 into a virulence factor for infection, unveiling a mechanism of action for this highly proficient human pathogen. How Shigella can be infectious in humans despite lacking clear mechanisms for mucosal adhesion remains a long-standing enigma concerning its pathogenesis. Xu et al. demonstrate that Shigella exploits the host defense peptide HD5 in the gut to attain its ability to colonize and destroy the intestinal epithelium.},

We determined that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in macrophage infected with Mycobacterium avium or M smegmatis is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and TLR2 but not TLR4, MR, or CR3. Interestingly, the TLR2-mediated production of TNF-α by macrophages infected with M smegmatis required the β-glucan receptor dectin-1. A similar requirement for dectin-1 in TNF-α production was observed for macrophages infected with M bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), M phlei, M avium 2151-rough, and M tuberculosis H37Ra. The limited production of TNF-α by virulent M avium 724 and M tuberculosis H37Rv was not dependent on dectin-1. Furthermore, dectin-1 facilitated interleukin-6 (IL-6), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production by mycobacteria-infected macrophages. These are the first results to establish a significant role for dectin-1, in cooperation with TLR2, to activate a macrophage's proinflammatory response to a mycobacterial infection.},

Being enveloped, the life cycle of this group of viruses is critically dependent on host lipid biosynthesis. Viral binding and entry involve interactions between viral envelope glycoproteins and cellular receptors localized to lipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane. Subsequent infection by these viruses leads to reorganization of cellular membranes and lipid metabolism to support the production of new viral particles. Recent work has focused on defining the involvement of specific lipid classes in the entry, genome replication assembly, and viral particle formation of these viruses in hopes of identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment or prevention of disease. In this review, we will highlight the role of host sphingolipids in the lifecycle of several medically important enveloped RNA viruses.},

  abstract = {The non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway is crucial for the immune system. A critical event in activation of the non-canonical pathway is the attenuation of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) degradation, which is promoted by continuous polyubiquitination of NIK catalyzed by the NIK ubiquitin-ligase complex composed of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and TRAF3. However, the molecular mechanism of stimulation-dependent NIK stabilization remains poorly understood. Here, we show that A20, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme, promotes efficient activation of the non-canonical pathway independent of its catalytic activity. A20 directly binds to cIAP1 through the seventh zinc finger of A20, resulting in dissociation of the TRAF2/TRAF3 interaction, thereby inactivating the ligase complex to stabilize NIK. Given that A20 negatively regulates the canonical pathway, A20 is likely involved in the molecular switch that promotes the transition from canonical to non-canonical activation for proper control of the immune system.},

  abstract = {Lysenin, a novel 41-kDa protein purified from coelomic fluid of the earthworm Eisenia foetida, induced erythrocyte lysis. Preincubation of lysenin with vesicles containing sphingomyelin inhibited lysenin-induced hemolysis completely, whereas vesicles containing phospholipids other than sphingomyelin showed no inhibitory activity, suggesting that lysenin bound specifically to sphingomyelin on erythrocyte membranes. The specific binding of lysenin to sphingomyelin was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TLC immunostaining, and liposome lysis assay. In these assays, lysenin bound specifically to sphingomyelin and did not show any cross-reaction with other phospholipids including sphingomyelin analogs such as sphingosine, ceramide, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, indicating that it recognized a precise molecular structure of sphingomyelin. Kinetic analysis of the lysenin-sphingomyelin interaction by surface plasmon resonance measurements using BIAcoreTM system showed that lysenin associated with membrane surfaces composed of sphingomyelin (kon = 3.2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1) and dissociated extremely slowly (koff = 1.7 x 10(-4) s-1), giving a low dissociation constant (KD = 5.3 x 10(-9) M). Incorporation of cholesterol into the sphingomyelin membrane significantly increased the total amount of lysenin bound to the membrane, whereas it did not change the kinetic parameters of the lysenin-membrane interaction, suggesting that lysenin specifically recognized sphingomyelin and cholesterol incorporation changed the topological distribution of sphingomyelin in the membranes, thereby increasing the accessibility of sphingomyelin to lysenin. Immunofluorescence staining of fibroblasts derived from a patient with Niemann-Pick disease type A showed that lysenin stained the surfaces of the fibroblasts uniformly, whereas intense lysosomal staining was observed when the cells were permeabilized by digitonin treatment. Preincubation of lysenin with vesicles containing sphingomyelin abolished lysenin immunostaining. This study demonstrated that lysenin bound specifically to sphingomyelin on cellular membranes and should be a useful tool to probe the molecular motion and function of sphingomyelin in biological membranes.},

  abstract = {Mincle (also called as Clec4e and Clecsf9) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed in activated phagocytes. Recently, we have demonstrated that Mincle is an FcRγ-associated activating receptor that senses damaged cells. To search an exogenous ligand(s), we screened pathogenic fungi using cell line expressing Mincle, FcRγ, and NFAT-GFP reporter. We found that Mincle specifically recognizes the Malassezia species among 50 different fungal species tested. Malassezia is a pathogenic fungus that causes skin diseases, such as tinea versicolor and atopic dermatitis, and fatal sepsis. However, the specific receptor on host cells has not been identified. Mutation of the putative mannose-binding motif within C-type lectin domain of Mincle abrogated Malassezia recognition. Analyses of glycoconjugate microarray revealed that Mincle selectively binds to α-mannose but not mannan. Thus, Mincle may recognize specific geometry of α-mannosyl residues on Malassezia species and use this to distinguish them from other fungi. Malassezia activated macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. To elucidate the physiological function of Mincle, Mincle-deficient mice were established. Malassezia-induced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages from Mincle-/- mice was significantly impaired. In vivo inflammatory responses against Malassezia was also impaired in Mincle-/- mice. These results indicate that Mincle is the first specific receptor for Malassezia species to be reported and plays a crucial role in immune responses to this fungus. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell lipid response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS)-based lipidomics approach. Our results revealed that glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) were significantly elevated in the HCoV-229E-infected cells and the linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was markedly perturbed upon HCoV-229E infection. Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA in HCoV-229E-infected cells significantly suppressed HCoV-229E virus replication. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of LA and AA on virus replication was also conserved for the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study demonstrated that host lipid metabolic remodeling was significantly associated with human-pathogenic coronavirus propagation. Our data further suggested that lipid metabolism regulation would be a common and druggable target for coronavirus infections.},

In this study, we show that in primary human neutrophils, coronins-1-4 and -7 are expressed. Coronin-1 accumulates at the leading edge of migrating neutrophils and at the nascent phagosome. Inhibition of coronin function by transduction of a dominant-negative form of the protein leads to inhibition of chemotaxis and a reduction in neutrophil spreading and adhesion. This inhibition appears to correlate with changes in the distribution of F-actin structures within the cell. In addition, phagocytosis is inhibited, but neither secretion nor activation of the NADPH oxidase appears to be affected. Together, these results show that coronins are required for actin-dependent changes in cell morphology that lead to migration and phagocytosis.},

  abstract = {Cancer is one of the most leading causes of mortalities worldwide. It is caused by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in 2 types of genes: tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and proto-oncogenes. In recent years, development of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has revolutionized genome engineering for different cancer research ranging for research ranging from fundamental science to translational medicine and precise cancer treatment. The CRISPR/CRISPR associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) are prokaryote-derived genome editing systems that have enabled researchers to detect, image, manipulate and annotate specific DNA and RNA sequences in various types of living cells. The CRISPR/Cas systems have significant contributions to discovery of proto-oncogenes and TSGs, tumor cell epigenome normalization, targeted delivery, identification of drug resistance mechanisms, development of high-throughput genetic screening, tumor models establishment, and cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy in clinics. Robust technical improvements in CRISPR/Cas systems have shown a considerable degree of efficacy, specificity, and flexibility to target the specific locus in the genome for the desired applications. Recent developments in CRISPRs technology offers a significant hope of medical cure against cancer and other deadly diseases. Despite significant improvements in this field, several technical challenges need to be addressed, such as off-target activity, insufficient indel or low homology-directed repair (HDR) efficiency, in vivo delivery of the Cas system components, and immune responses. This study aims to overview the recent technological advancements, preclinical and perspectives on clinical applications of CRISPR along with their advantages and limitations. Moreover, the potential applications of CRISPR/Cas in precise cancer tumor research, genetic, and other precise cancer treatments discussed.},

The current inhibitors of ERK1/2 target ATP binding or the catalytic site and are therefore limited in their utility for elucidating the complex biological roles of ERK1/2 through its phosphorylation and regulation of over 100 substrate proteins. To overcome this limitation, a combination of computational and experimental methods was used to identify low-molecular-mass inhibitors that are intended to target ERK1/2 substrate-docking domains and selectively interfere with ERK1/2 regulation of substrate proteins. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of compounds with a thienyl benzenesulfonate scaffold that were designed to inhibit ERK1/2 substrates containing an F-site or DEF (docking site for ERK, FXF) motif. Experimental evidence shows the compounds inhibit the expression of F-site containing immediate early genes (IEGs) of the Fos family, including c-Fos and Fra1, and transcriptional regulation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex. Moreover, this class of compounds selectively induces apoptosis in melanoma cells containing mutated BRaf and constitutively active ERK1/2 signalling, including melanoma cells that are inherently resistant to clinically relevant kinase inhibitors. These findings represent the identification and initial characterization of a novel class of compounds that inhibit ERK1/2 signalling functions and their potential utility for elucidating ERK1/2 and other signalling events that control the growth and survival of cancer cells containing elevated ERK1/2 activity.},

Fatty acid metabolism-related genes are relatively overrepresented in the mycobacterial genome and mycobacteria favor host-derived fatty acids as nutrient sources. However, whether and how mycobacteria modulate host fatty acid metabolism to drive granuloma progression remains unknown. Here, we report that mycobacteria under hypoxia markedly secrete the protein Rv0859/MMAR\_4677 (Fatty-acid degradation A, FadA), which is also enriched in tuberculous granulomas. FadA acts as an acetyltransferase that converts host acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA. The reduced acetyl-CoA level suppresses H3K9Ac-mediated expression of the host proinflammatory cytokine               Il6               , thus promoting granuloma progression. Moreover, supplementation of acetate increases the level of acetyl-CoA and inhibits the formation of granulomas. Our findings suggest an unexpected mechanism of a hypoxia-induced mycobacterial protein suppressing host immunity via modulation of host fatty acid metabolism and raise the possibility of a novel therapeutic strategy for TB infection.},

In this study, we investigated the role of RD1 in interleukin-1α (IL-1α) secretion. M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain, but not a mutant strain deficient for RD1 (\{increment\}RD1), significantly induced IL-1α secretion from infected macrophages. Although IL-1α secretion was only observed in H37Rv-infected macrophages, there was no difference in the level of IL-1α transcription and pro-IL1α synthesis after infection with H37Rv and \{increment\}RD1. Interestingly, \{increment\}RD1 infection did not increase intracellular Ca2+ levels, and Ca2+ chelators markedly inhibited IL-1α secretion in response to H37Rv infection. Moreover, the inability of \{increment\}RD1 to induce IL-1α secretion was restored by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. A significant increase in calpain activity was detected in macrophages infected with H37Rv, but not with \{increment\}RD1, and calpain inhibitors abrogated IL-1α secretion. Taken together, these results suggest that in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, RD1 contributed to maturation and secretion of IL-1α by enhancing the influx of Ca2+ followed by calpain activation. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

  abstract = {Background                                Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by                 Mycobacterium tuberculosis                 (                 Mtb                 ) and remains a major health threat worldwide. However, a detailed understanding of the immune cells and inflammatory mediators in                 Mtb                 -infected tissues is still lacking. Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE), which is characterized by an influx of immune cells to the pleural space, is thus a suitable platform for dissecting complex tissue responses to                 Mtb                 infection.                                                        Methods               We employed singe-cell RNA sequencing to 10 pleural fluid (PF) samples from 6 patients with TPE and 4 non-TPEs including 2 samples from patients with TSPE (transudative pleural effusion) and 2 samples with MPE (malignant pleural effusion).                                         Result               Compared to TSPE and MPE, TPE displayed obvious difference in the abundance of major cell types (e.g., NK, CD4+T, Macrophages), which showed notable associations with disease type. Further analyses revealed that the CD4 lymphocyte population in TPE favored a Th1 and Th17 response. Tumor necrosis factors (TNF)-, and XIAP related factor 1 (XAF1)-pathways induced T cell apoptosis in patients with TPE. Immune exhaustion in NK cells was an important feature in TPE. Myeloid cells in TPE displayed stronger functional capacity for phagocytosis, antigen presentation and IFN-γ response, than TSPE and MPE. Systemic elevation of inflammatory response genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines were mainly driven by macrophages in patients with TPE.                                         Conclusion               We provide a tissue immune landscape of PF immune cells, and revealed a distinct local immune response in TPE and non-TPE (TSPE and MPE). These findings will improve our understanding of local TB immunopathogenesis and provide potential targets for TB therapy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) sits at the crossroads of sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide, diacylglycerol (DAG) metabolism. It utilizes ceramide and phosphatidylcholine as substrates to produce SM and DAG, thereby regulating lipid messengers which play a role in cell survival and apoptosis. Furthermore, its product SM has been implicated in atherogenic processes such as retention of lipoproteins in the blood vessel intima. There are two mammalian sphingomyelin synthases: SMS1 and SMS2. SMS1 is found exclusively in the Golgi at steady state, whereas SMS2 exists in the Golgi and plasma membrane. Conventional motifs responsible for protein targeting to the plasma membrane or Golgi are either not present in, or unique to, SMS1 and SMS2. In this study, we examined how SMS1 and SMS2 achieve their respective subcellular localization patterns. Brefeldin A treatment prevented SMS1 and SMS2 from exiting the ER, demonstrating that they transit through the classical secretory pathway. We created truncations and chimeras of SMS1 and SMS2 to define their targeting signals. We found that SMS1 contains a C-terminal Golgi targeting signal and that SMS2 contains a C-terminal plasma membrane targeting signal.},

Although the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine is comparatively abundant, its contribution to the surface charge of individual cellular membranes is unknown, partly because of the lack of reagents to analyze its distribution in intact cells. We developed a biosensor to study the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylserine and found that it binds the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as endosomes and lysosomes. The negative charge associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine directed proteins with moderately positive charge to the endocytic pathway. More strongly cationic proteins, normally associated with the plasma membrane, relocalized to endocytic compartments when the plasma membrane surface charge decreased on calcium influx.},

In this study, we performed global transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on PPE57-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and control samples to quantitatively measure the expression level of key transcripts of interest. A total of 1367 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in response to a 6 h exposure to PPE57, with 685 being up-regulated and 682 down-regulated. Immune-related gene functions and pathways associated with these genes were evaluated, revealing that the type I IFN signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway in our RNA-seq dataset, with 14 DEGs identified therein including               ISG15, MX2, IRF9, IFIT3, IFIT2, OAS3, IFIT1, IFI6, OAS2, OASL, RSAD2, OAS1, IRF7               , and               MX1               . These PPE57-related transcriptomic profiles have implications for a better understanding of host global immune mechanisms underlying               MTB               infection outcomes. However, more studies regarding these DEGs and type I IFN signaling in this infectious context are necessary to more fully clarify the underlying mechanisms that arise in response to PPE57 during               MTB               infection.},

  abstract = {The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, play an important role in the innate immune system by recognizing, engulfing, and eliminating pathogens. It has been suggested that lipid membrane microdomains/rafts of phagocytes are involved in these innate immune responses, including superoxide generation, cell migration, and phagocytosis. Lactosylceramide (LacCer), a neutral glycosphingolipid, forms glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains together with the Src family kinase, Lyn, on the neutrophil plasma membrane. LacCer-enriched microdomains have been suggested to play important roles in innate immune function of neutrophils. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain largely unknown. Recent proteomic analyses of microdomains from phagocytes have provided insight into membrane microdomain-mediated functions in the processes of phagocytosis. In this review, we discuss the membrane microdomain-associated immune functions of phagocytes, focusing on those functions of LacCer-enriched microdomains and recent proteomic approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we present a fast and sensitive approach for direct peptide identification from DIA data, MSFragger-DIA, which leverages the unmatched speed of the fragment ion indexing-based search engine MSFragger. Different from most existing methods, MSFragger-DIA conducts a database search of the DIA tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra prior to spectral feature detection and peak tracing across the LC dimension. To streamline the analysis of DIA data and enable easy reproducibility, we integrate MSFragger-DIA into the FragPipe computational platform for seamless support of peptide identification and spectral library building from DIA, data-dependent acquisition (DDA), or both data types combined. We compare MSFragger-DIA with other DIA tools, such as DIA-Umpire based workflow in FragPipe, Spectronaut, DIA-NN library-free, and MaxDIA. We demonstrate the fast, sensitive, and accurate performance of MSFragger-DIA across a variety of sample types and data acquisition schemes, including single-cell proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and large-scale tumor proteome profiling studies.},

  abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) causes disease ranging from dengue fever (DF), a self-limited febrile illness, to the potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DHF/DSS usually occurs in patients who have acquired DENV-reactive antibodies prior to infection, either from a previous infection with a heterologous DENV serotype or from an immune mother. Hence, it has been hypothesized that subneutralizing levels of antibodies exacerbate disease, a phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). However, given the lack of suitable animal models for DENV infection, the mechanism of ADE and its contribution to pathology remain elusive. Here we demonstrate in mice that DENV-specific antibodies can sufficiently increase severity of disease so that a mostly nonlethal illness becomes a fatal disease resembling human DHF/DSS. Antibodies promote massive infection of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), resulting in increased systemic levels of virus. Thus, a subprotective humoral response may, under some circumstances, have pathological consequences. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cells use mitophagy to remove damaged or unwanted mitochondria to maintain homeostasis. Here we report that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes exploits host mitophagy to evade killing. We found that L. monocytogenes induced mitophagy in macrophages through the virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO). We discovered that NLRX1, the only Nod-like receptor (NLR) family member with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and directly associated with LC3 through the LIR. NLRX1 and its LIR motif were essential for L. monocytogenes–induced mitophagy. NLRX1 deficiency and use of a mitophagy inhibitor both increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and thereby suppressed the survival of L. monocytogenes. Mechanistically, L. monocytogenes and LLO induced oligomerization of NLRX1 to promote binding of its LIR motif to LC3 for induction of mitophagy. Our study identifies NLRX1 as a novel mitophagy receptor and discovers a previously unappreciated strategy used by pathogens to hijack a host cell homeostasis system for their survival.},

A less well explored feature is the role of GSLs in immune cell function which is the subject of this review article. Here we summarize knowledge on GSL expression patterns in different immune cells. We review the changes in GSL expression during immune cell development and differentiation, maturation and activation. Furthermore, we review how immune cell GSLs impact membrane organization, molecular signaling and trans-interactions in cellular cross-talk. Another aspect covered is the role of GSLs as targets of antibody-based immunity in cancer. We expect that recent advances in analytical and genome editing technologies will help in the coming years to further our knowledge on the role of GSLs as modulators of immune cell function.},

  abstract = {Two zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs)-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-have crossed species to cause severe human respiratory disease. Here, we showed that induction of airway memory CD4+ T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pan-coronavirus vaccines. Airway memory CD4+ T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lung-derived cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was dependent on interferon-γ and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4+ T cells targeting conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and other respiratory virus outbreaks. Zoonotic CoVs have emerged twice in the past 10 years and have caused severe human respiratory disease. Using an alphavirus vaccine vector, Perlman and colleagues show that intranasal vaccination induces airway memory CD4+ T cell responses that protect mice from lethal challenge and are cross-reactive to different CoVs.},

However, we recently showed that inefficient immune activation and a poor virus-specific T cell response underlie severe disease in SARS-CoV-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that virus-specific T cells, in the absence of activation of the innate immune response, were sufficient to significantly enhance survival and diminish clinical disease. We demonstrated that T cells are responsible for virus clearance, as intravenous adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-immune splenocytes or in vitro -generated T cells to SCID or BALB/c mice enhanced survival and reduced virus titers in the lung. Enhancement of the number of virus-specific CD8 T cells by immunization with SARS-CoV peptide-pulsed dendritic cells also resulted in a robust T cell response, earlier virus clearance, and increased survival. These studies are the first to show that T cells play a crucial role in SARS-CoV clearance and that a suboptimal T cell response contributes to the pathological changes observed in SARS. They also provide a new approach to SARS vaccine design.},

  abstract = {Purpose. To characterize the phagocytosis of extracellular matrix components by retinal pigment epithelial cells and to determine which receptors and signal transduction pathways are involved. Methods. Fluorescent latex beads were coated with fibronectin (FN), collagen type I or IV, or thrombospondin and incubated with human retinal pigment epithelial cells for 3 hours. Phagocytosis was quantified by flow cytometry. The effects of adhesion blocking antibodies to cell surface receptors (α1, α3, α5, β1, α5β1, ανβ3, ανβ5 integrins and CD36) and inhibitors of specific intracellular signaling pathways (tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase [PI3-kinase], protein kinase C [PKC], and mitogen-activated protein kinase) were determined using FN-coated beads. Results. Phagocytosis of FN- coated beads was greater than phagocytosis of beads coated with collagen type I, collagen type IV, or thrombospondin or uncoated controls (P {$<$} 0.0005). Anti-α5, -β1, and -α5β1 antibodies markedly inhibited FN phagocytosis (P {$<$} 0.0005); the inhibitory effects of anti-α5 antibody were stronger in the initial stages (binding) than in the later stages (internalization) of phagocytosis. There was no significant effect on phagocytosis when anti- α1, -α3, -ανβ5, -ανβ3 or -CD36 antibodies were used. Fibronectin phagocytosis was decreased by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (genistein, 100 μg/ml, P {$<$} 0.005) and PI3-kinase (wortmannin, 5 μM, P {$<$} 0.01), but these reagents did not affect the uncoated controls. The PKC inhibitor calphostin C (400 nM) nonspecifically increased the phagocytosis of FN-coated (P {$<$} 0.05) and uncoated beads (P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions. Subconfluent retinal pigment epithelial cells preferentially phagocytose FN over other extracellular matrix components. Phagocytosis of FN utilizes the α5β1 integrin, is mediated in part through tyrosine kinase and PI3-kinase signaling pathways, and is modulated by PKC. Phagocytosis of extracellular matrix by retinal pigment epithelial cells may represent a novel mechanism for remodeling of the provisional extracellular matrix during outer retinal wound healing.},

  abstract = {Airborne bacteria are an influential component of the Earth’s microbiomes, but their community structure and biogeographic distribution patterns have yet to be understood. We analyzed the bacterial communities of 370 air particulate samples collected from 63 sites around the world and constructed an airborne bacterial reference catalog with more than 27 million nonredundant 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. We present their biogeographic pattern and decipher the interlacing of the microbiome co-occurrence network with surface environments of the Earth. While the total abundance of global airborne bacteria in the troposphere (1.72 × 10               24               cells) is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of other habitats, the number of bacterial taxa (i.e., richness) in the atmosphere (4.71 × 10               8               to 3.08 × 10               9               ) is comparable to that in the hydrosphere, and its maximum occurs in midlatitude regions, as is also observed in other ecosystems. The airborne bacterial community harbors a unique set of dominant taxa (24 species); however, its structure appears to be more easily perturbed, due to the more prominent role of stochastic processes in shaping community assembly. This is corroborated by the major contribution of surface microbiomes to airborne bacteria (averaging 46.3\%), while atmospheric conditions such as meteorological factors and air quality also play a role. Particularly in urban areas, human impacts weaken the relative importance of plant sources of airborne bacteria and elevate the occurrence of potential pathogens from anthropogenic sources. These findings serve as a key reference for predicting planetary microbiome responses and the health impacts of inhalable microbiomes with future changes in the environment.},

Researchers led by Huaxi Xu of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, USA, and Qi Wang of the Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine investigated TREM2 transport by searching for proteins that interact with it. They found that presenilin 1, which has also been implicated in AD, regulates TREM2 transport and affects activation of microglia.

Reciprocally, many membrane-associated proteins can modulate the shape, lipid composition, and dynamics of cellular membranes. Determining the exact mechanisms by which these proteins interact with membranes will be essential to understanding their biological functions. In this Technical Perspective, we provide a brief introduction to selected biochemical methods that can be applied to study protein–lipid interactions. We also discuss how important it is to choose proper lipid composition, type of model membrane, and biochemical assay to obtain reliable and informative data from the lipid-interaction mechanism of a protein of interest.},

We found, however, that treatment of ATP-depleted macrophages and fibroblasts with exogenous sphingomyelinase (SMase) rapidly induces formation of numerous vesicles that pinch off from the plasma membrane; the process is complete within 10 min after adding SMase. By electron microscopy, the SMase-induced vesicles are approximately 400 nm in diameter and lack discernible coats. 15-30\% of plasma membrane is internalized by SMase treatment, and there is no detectable enrichment of either clathrin or caveolin in these vesicles. When ATP is restored to the cells, the SMase-induced vesicles are able to deliver fluid-phase markers to late endosomes/lysosomes and return recycling receptors, such as transferrin receptors, back to the plasma membrane. We speculate that hydrolysis of sphingomyelin on the plasma membrane causes inward curvature and subsequent fusion to form sealed vesicles. Many cell types express a SMase that can be secreted or delivered to endosomes and lysosomes. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by these enzymes is activated by several signaling pathways, and this may lead to formation of vesicles by the process described here.},

  abstract = {Plasma membranes of animal cells are enriched for cholesterol. Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are pore-forming toxins secreted by bacteria that target membrane cholesterol for their effector function. Phagocytes are essential for clearance of CDC-producing bacteria; however, the mechanisms by which these cells evade the deleterious effects of CDCs are largely unknown. Here, we report that interferon (IFN) signals convey resistance to CDC-induced pores on macrophages and neutrophils. We traced IFN-mediated resistance to CDCs to the rapid modulation of a specific pool of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of macrophages without changes to total cholesterol levels. Resistance to CDC-induced pore formation requires the production of the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and redistribution of cholesterol to an esterified cholesterol pool. Accordingly, blocking the ability of IFN to reprogram cholesterol metabolism abrogates cellular protection and renders mice more susceptible to CDC-induced tissue damage. These studies illuminate targeted regulation of membrane cholesterol content as a host defense strategy.},

T helper type 1 (Th1) cells stably express IFN-γ, whereas Th2 cells express IL-4. The discovery and investigation of two other CD4+ T~cell subsets, induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells and Th17 cells, has led to a rethinking of the notion that helper T~cell subsets represent irreversibly differentiated endpoints. Accumulating evidence suggests that CD4+ T~cells, particularly iTreg and Th17 cells, are more plastic than previously appreciated. It appears that expression of Foxp3 by iTreg cells or IL-17 by Th17 cells may not be stable and that there is a great degree of flexibility in their differentiation options.

At mucosal surfaces Th17 cells are thought to protect the host from infection while regulatory T (Treg) cells control immune responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora 1–5 . Differentiation of both cell types requires TGF-β, but depends on distinct transcription factors, RORγt for Th17 and Foxp3 for Treg cells 6-8 . How TGF-β regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing activities has been perplexing. Here, we demonstrate that together with pro-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β orchestrates Th17 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations, TGF-β synergizes with IL-6 and IL-21 (ref. 9 -11) to promote IL-23R expression, favoring Th17 cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-β repress IL-23R expression and favor Foxp3 + Treg cells. RORγt and Foxp3 are co-expressed in naïve CD4 + T cells exposed to TGF-β and in a subset of T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria (LP). In vitro, TGF-β-induced Foxp3 inhibits RORγt function at least in part through their interaction. Accordingly, LP T cells that co-express both transcription factors produce less IL-17 than those that express RORγt alone. IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23 relieve Foxp3-mediated inhibition of RORγt, thereby promoting Th17 cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen-stimulated cells to differentiate into Th17 or Treg cells depends upon the cytokine-regulated balance of RORγt and Foxp3.},

  abstract = {Regulation of animal development in response to nutritional cues is an intensely studied problem related to disease and aging. While extensive studies indicated roles of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) in sensing certain nutrients for controlling growth and metabolism, the role of fatty acids and lipids in TOR-involved nutrient/food responses are obscure. Caenorhabditis elegans halts postembryonic growth and development shortly after hatching in response to monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid (mmBCFA) deficiency. Here, we report that an mmBCFA-derived sphingolipid, d17iso-glucosylceramide, is a critical metabolite in regulating growth and development. Further analysis indicated that this lipid function is mediated by TORC1 and antagonized by the NPRL-2/3 complex in the intestine. Strikingly, the essential lipid function is bypassed by activating TORC1 or inhibiting NPRL-2/3. Our findings uncover a novel lipid-TORC1 signaling pathway that coordinates nutrient and metabolic status with growth and development, advancing our understanding of the physiological roles of mmBCFAs, ceramides, and TOR.

  abstract = {Abstract             Population-based association studies have identified many genetic risk loci for coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is often unclear how genes within these loci are linked to CAD. Here, we perform interaction proteomics for 11 CAD-risk genes to map their protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human vascular cells and elucidate their roles in CAD. The resulting PPI networks contain interactions that are outside of known biology in the vasculature and are enriched for genes involved in immunity-related and arterial-wall-specific mechanisms. Several PPI networks derived from smooth muscle cells are significantly enriched for genetic variants associated with CAD and related vascular phenotypes. Furthermore, the networks identify 61 genes that are found in genetic loci associated with risk of CAD, prioritizing them as the causal candidates within these loci. These findings indicate that the PPI networks we have generated are a rich resource for guiding future research into the molecular pathogenesis of CAD.},

  abstract = {Marine viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans shaping community structure and nutrient cycling. The interaction between the bloom-forming alga Emiliania huxleyi and its specific large dsDNA virus (EhV) is a major factor determining the fate of carbon in the ocean, thus serving as a key host-pathogen model system. The EhV genome encodes for a set of genes involved in the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis, not reported in any viral genome to date. We combined detailed lipidomic and biochemical analyses to characterize the functional role of this virus-encoded pathway during lytic viral infection. We identified a major metabolic shift, mediated by differential substrate specificity of virus-encoded serine palmitoyltransferase, a key enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Consequently, unique viral glycosphingolipids, composed of unusual hydroxylated C17 sphingoid bases (t17:0) were highly enriched in the infected cells, and their synthesis was found to be essential for viral assembly. These findings uncover the biochemical bases of the virus-induced metabolic rewiring of the host sphingolipid biosynthesis during the chemical "arms race" in the ocean.},

Sanatoriums were a hybrid between a hospital and a resort, built to maximise patients’ exposure to sunlight and clean air. Their bright, open spaces influenced both healthcare and modern architecture. But a darker aspect of sanatorium care, as Sadie Levy Gale discovered, was the extent to which TB patients were monitored and policed during their stay.},
